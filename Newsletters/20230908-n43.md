# Opportunities
* The [call for support](https://tudelft.nl/dcc/call) from the **Digital Competence Center** is open until **9 October**.
You can request support from Data Managers and Research Software Engineers to work on a project and make your software and data more **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).
If you want to learn more, there is an [information session]( https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIe5OoS3PKchtBoa_30gjV-5VUNEw2VjJVUDlZVkhHSTAwMkNTVUM1MkpNOCQlQCN0PWcu&wdLOR=cD395AC40-520B-4782-B49A-C785B6A0F303) on **21 September** (15:00-16:00).
You can also watch a [5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eoI98_jQpo) to hear from other researchers how the support helped them. 
* Already have experience with managing Data and Software and you want to **join TU Delft’s Digital Competence Center**?
There are **vacancies** for a [Data Manager](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=13670&jobTitle=Data%20Manager) (**18 September**) and [Software Engineer](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=13766&jobTitle=Research%20Software%20Engineer) (**24 September**). 
* **The Turing Way** [Book Dash applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13QsDH0rHtI3qRCj9yem4_iXHrVKb_9wZtQ-ALkpbYtk) are open until **15 September**.
This is an opportunity to contribute to the Turing Way, a book reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.
The Book Dash is an online (and probably also in-person!) event where you learn how to do this using GitHub. If you have any questions about this, please contact Esther. 
* The library has a vacancy for a PhD candidate to work on a pilot for **Open Scholarly Communications and Publishing**.
The pilot is expected to run until the end of this year, with possibilities of extension.
The expected amount of time is ~8 a week, with room for flexibility. The work is paid. Please contact Frédérique Beillard for the details (email), or [fill out the expression of interest form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIe8bJdB4xVCBGhSJeFdGAK1BUMU5VSFFUUUdIT0lJM0FGVTJRSEY4UDVIRS4u&wdLOR=c6FB24DDF-329F-4D6F-8C96-E1446B5103D9).
* The **BioRender pilot** is now a [standard service of TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/library-voor-onderzoekers/library-voor-onderzoekers/publiceren-verspreiden/biorender)!
BioRender allows you to create professional **figures** in minutes through the use of pre-made icons and templates. 
* **Reminder:** Join the **Open Hardware Academy** in a 10-week program that will help you develop your own open hardware project!
The programme starts on **29 September**.
