# Other
* Promovendi Netwerk Nederland (PNN) has [vacancies for board members](https://hetpnn.nl/actueel/vacature-bestuurslid-pnn/) available. 
PNN is the national interest group for and by PhD candidates in the Netherlands.
* The [annual quota for open access publications under the Springer Nature agreement has been met](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2024/library/maximum-number-of-springer-nature-open-access-publications-reached): This means that you may now face costs for publishing in open access in certain journals - if you run into this issue contact the TU Delft Library immediately via library@tudelft.nl. 
* Don’t forget that there is **software support** and [guidance](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io) from the Digital Competence Center ([DCC]( https://www.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=67120&L=1/)) and [documentation from Delft Blue](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/) (**TU Delft HPC**).
* And because I have not sent enough resources on Open Education yet, a conference contribution about how [Open Education alone is not the solution to all of our problems in Higher Education]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S_a2AX-k4k). 
* I did set up an [overview of Open Educational Resources at Applied Sciences](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-education-at-applied-sciences) – check it out or add your resources by emailing myself or Sophie!
