If you cannot make these dates, the workshops are usually [livestreamed on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery) (with videos being taken down after the workshop).
*	The eScience Center is organising a **Data Carpentry workshop** that introduces data organisation and cleaning in spreadsheets, **Open Refine** and introduces **Python** (**6-9 Dec**, 9:00-13:00 online) for **beginners**. 
[Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-carpentry-with-python-tickets-211744853557) closes on **1 Dec**.
* You can also go over the materials of the ‘**Intermediate Research Software Development in Python**’ course in your own time as [all the materials are available online/on GitHub](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/).

## Open Science Course:
* The next round of applications for the [Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org) is opening up tomorrow and will close on the **15th of January 2022**! 
Although the title says Life Sciences, it is open to a wide range of disciplines. 
* By participating in this 16 week course you will learn all about Open Science principles and practices and to top that: [receive 5 GS discipline specific credits](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme)! 
More information from the Faculty Graduate School will follow.
* The programme is hosting an introduction webinar where you can learn more about the programme and ask all your questions on **14 December 17:00**. 
* If you have any doubts whether you would like to participate, please get in touch with myself or Emmy Tsang (F.Tsang[at]tudelft.nl). 

## Software citation:
* Want to learn how to make your software citable? 
The Turing Way now has a guide on [Software Citation with CITATION.cff](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cff.html). 
* You can also go over this [Software Citation Checklist for Authors](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3479199).

## Methods:
* Did your recent experiment fail? 
[This Twitter post](https://twitter.com/IamKhanPhD/status/1450815000222838784) or a more serious [blogpost on negative results](https://medium.com/psychphdpathway/emptying-psychologys-file-drawer-6909cf6b7eb) are for you. 
Note that you can still publish on these experiments through journals such as the [Journal of Trial and Error](https://www.jtrialerror.com/) and [Experimental Results](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/experimental-results).
* You can also **share your methods** through platforms such as [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/). 
See this feature on ‘[Five keys to writing a reproducible lab protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02428-3)’ for some pointers.
