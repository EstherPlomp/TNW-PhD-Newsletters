# Machine/deep learning things
* [Sign up for a **machine learning newsletter**](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jesperdramsch).
*	[Read about five ways](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02964-6) **deep learning has transformed image analysis**, also with the help of Citizen Science!
*	[Lex](https://lex.page) is a **new word processor with AI assistance** to help you to write. 
You can sign up to test it (you’ll eventually need a licence), or email me if you need an invite (first come, first served). 
*	Check out [**visual explanations** of machine learning concepts](https://mlu-explain.github.io/).

# Open Peer Review
* **The Turing Way** has a chapter on [Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review.html), including a section on [Open Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review/peer-review-open.html).
* Listen to some [tips to **manage peer review**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00381-1) (also check out the episode on [how to publish a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00292-1)).
* To **suggest peer reviewers** to the editor/journal, remember when other researchers interacted with you (meetings, conferences, Twitter). 
Write their names down somewhere (a reviewers.txt file). 
Or check which articles/authors you're citing!
* How do you **respond to a review**? 
[EASE provides a 6 step guide](https://ease.org.uk/communities/peer-review-committee/peer-review-toolkit/how-to-respond-to-reviewers-comments/) and [Dan Quintana wrote a short blog](https://www.dsquintana.blog/reviewer-response/) about this.
* Watch a panel on ‘[Discussion on Peer Review: **"Thinking With” When Peer Reviewing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iYMeWA-IGo&t=2680s)’.
* Check the [**Open Reviewers Review Guide**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5484087). 
Pages 28-31 provide insights about what a reviewer would look for when evaluating your manuscript.
* Read some [reflections on **reviewing in the publishing system**](http://neural-reckoning.org/reviewing.html).
