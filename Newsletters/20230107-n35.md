# Open Science program

As announced by the Faculty Graduate School in December, you can apply for the next round of an Open Science training Program! 
This program provides you with the essential knowledge and skills to manage your research project according to the recommended **Open Science** practices. 
* You will be supported by a mentor with a connection to your discipline/project. 
* The program is eligible for your Doctoral Education Program (**5 discipline-related credits**). 
See [intranet](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme) for more details. 
* The Applied Sciences **information session** will take place **later today, 9 January, at 16:00** via: https://tudelft.zoom.us/j/95946581533?pwd=ajcxQU9IMnhiNkZDZUVLVURXNzdmZz09. You  can also [watch an older recording](https://youtu.be/rksUzRDFn20) or read a [blog post]( https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/12/01/announcing-applications-for-ols-7/) for more info. 
* Application deadline is **15 January**. 
* Please reach out to Esther or the Open Life Science Team (team[at]openlifesci.org) if you have any questions.

# Faculty Research Data Management 101 course

The [Research Data Management 101 course](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101), offered via the central Graduate School (GS), is currently already fully enrolled for the rest of the academic year. 
We are therefore organising an Applied Sciences Faculty version of this course between **21 February – 28 March**. 
* This course is particularly relevant for **first year PhDs** and includes setting up a Data Management Plan (one of the requirements for the Go-No/Go!).
* The faculty version will be open to all Applied Science PhD candidates, consist of two in-person sessions instead of three online sessions, and will use a website/GitHub for the self- paced content (instead of Brightspace). 
Other than this, the main materials, assignments and Graduate School Credits you'll receive are identical (**1.5 credits for Research Skills**).
* Please fill out [the form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/Rnv5nz6Cxd) to **register** for the faculty version of this course before **20 February 17:00**.
