# Opportunities

- **Finding Ada** is giving away 100 places to their six month mentoring program for **women in STEM**. Apply before **8 April**. 
See also this Slack panel on [Trailblazing women in tech](https://slackwomensday.splashthat.com/slackemail).
- **TU Delft Library** has two vacancies open for a [Community Manager](https://www.academictransfer.com/en/310351/4turesearchdata-community-manager/) and [Trainer for Research Data Management skills](https://www.academictransfer.com/en/310352/research-data-and-software-management-trainer/). 
You won't be working directly with me but I'm happy to answer any questions you have. 

# Software Sharing

- **Why share your code?**
[Read some reflections from the social sciences](https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/news/show.php?article=5705) that are widely applicable. 
- [Krafczyk et al. 2021]( https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0069) share some helpful **recommendations on how you can share your software** (pages 5-11). 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great platform to share software but it won’t **preserve your code for the long term.** (for example, [GitHub changed github.com to github.io](https://twitter.com/EmilyEscamilla_/status/1509252361310588932), resulting in a lot of broken links). 
Instead, you can preserve a snapshot of your code on either [Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) or [4TU.ResearchData (Connecting your GitHub/GitLab account)](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/about-your-data/getting-started). 
4TU.ResearchData also has an integration with the TU Delft instance of GitLab! 
Sharing your software via Zenodo/4TU.ResearchData will also make your code citable! See [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cff.html) for more information about **software citation**. 
- You may be asked to share your code by **peer reviewers**! 
  - [Read this blogpost on how peer review of software can improve the quality of your work]( https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/04/18/wild-standards/)
  - [Jan Jensen](https://twitter.com/janhjensen/status/1479434115397136392) won’t recommend publication if the code is not made freely available. 
See also the reactions to this approach in this [Twitter thread by Evelyne Deplazes](https://twitter.com/DeplazesEvelyne/status/1479625126458978305).  
- You can also use [notebooksharing](https://notebooksharing.space/) to **share your Jupyter and R Markdown notebooks** with co-authors. 
- [Lisa deBruine has written a short guide](https://twitter.com/LisaDeBruine/status/1504063177012695047) for authors that want to **share their code in a computationally reproducible way**. 
- The [Journal of Open Source Education]( https://jose.theoj.org/) **publishes open-source educational materials and software**.


# Tools 

- **Chem4Word** will allow you to draw different kinds of chemical reactions and specifying reactants, products, reaction type with reagents and conditions in Microsoft Word.
You can [download the betaversion](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/2022/03/15/all-new-for-2022-chem4word-does-chemical-reactions/) now and provide them with feedback!
- The [HemingWay Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) allows you to check if your sentences are **written clearly**. See also this [Twitter thread by Mercedes Gómez-López](https://twitter.com/dr_gomez_lopez/status/1503833830742016008) on **academic writing**.
- A [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/rust4bio/status/1479817227964760066) on **CLI tools for bioinformatics**. 
- The Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) and PDBe Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB) have tools available to **analysing binding sites in protein structures** (see the [recordings of a webinar](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/guide-analysing-binding-sites-protein-structures) they hosted on this topic). 

Also, [atoms are binary](https://twitter.com/KatysCartoons/status/1504463231380865031). Have a good week!
