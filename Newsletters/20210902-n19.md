# Programming Workshops
* The Netherlands eScience Center is organising a [workshop on using containers for reproducible research](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reproducible-computational-environments-using-containers-tickets-166924809599) in the mornings of **September 15-16**.
* Use Coachview (https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us) to check for the dates/availabilities of the TU Delft research data management and basic programming courses.

# Opportunities
* The next round of the **Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) Fellowship programme** opens for applications on the 9th of September. 
The Institute’s Fellowship Programme provides funding (3000 pounds) for individuals who want to improve how research software is done in their domains and/or area of work. 
See the [SSI website](https://software.ac.uk/news/ssi-fellowship-programme-2022) for more information and sign up to receive more information. 
* The Turing Institute is looking to **hire three [Research Data Scientists/Research Software Engineers](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering/join-us)**. Apply before the 10th of September. 
* Do you want to contribute to **[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)**? Participate in a collaborative online/hybrid event taking place between the **8-12 November**: [Apply through this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4jzL6_64lw2cBVgYh2o0dtA9zzdswFdvSKrlbnGX3HpPx7g/viewform) before the **1st of October**. 
No idea what this entails?
