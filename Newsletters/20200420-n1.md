Good afternoon!

I hope you are well considering the current circumstances. 

I would like to notify you of some online events related to data management that you can attend to learn something new or have some more online social interaction: 

If you want to learn more about **Open Science**, you can participate in [TU Delft’s Open Science online course](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/open-science-sharing-your-research-with-the-world). 
There is also an [Open Science Coffee moment](https://openscience-utrecht.com/oscoffee/) on the Friday afternoon (15:00-16:00) organised by Utrecht University. 
During this coffee moment, on the 29th of May, I’ll be discussing Registered Reports, a publication format where peer review takes place before and after data collection in order to prevent publication bias. 

Talking about **Registered Reports**: this is an article format which may be very handy if you just started your PhD and cannot collect data at the moment. 
The idea behind this format is that you set up your introduction and method section and then send it to the journal for peer review. 
Your article will then not be judged on the outcomes but on your proposed method/research question. 
A benefit of Registered Reports is that you get feedback from the reviewers before you start data collection instead of afterwards when you can’t really change that much anymore. 
The best part about Registered Reports is that if your article is accepted after the first stage of peer review, the journal has to publish it after you finished the article and submit it again (unless you completely deviated from your proposal of course). 
This way you have more certainty when you do the research that it will actually be published. Right now another benefit is that you can shift your workload of writing the article up to now, so that it will later be easier to write up the results and discussion and then publish it. 
You can find more information about Registered Reports on the [website of the Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/rr/), including templates and which journals offer this format (such as PLOS and Nature Human Behaviour).

As you may be aware, according to the TNW/AS Research Data Management Policy, PhD students that started after 1st of Jan 2019 will have to **share their data and code** that underlie the conclusions of their articles/PhD thesis using data repositories such as [4TU.ResearchData](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/home/). 
To prevent having to do this at the very end, it is a good idea to already have a look into this.

* Follow workshops on data management, such as the [online workshop on how to share code](https://software.hifis.net/events/2020/05/12/ready-script-for-publication) the 12th of May organised by HIFIS. 
* If you started after the 1st of Jan this year, you will also have to complete a **Data Management Plan** as part of the go-no-go meeting. 
You can use the online platform [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) to do this. 
You can find [more information on DMP on the Research Data Management website](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/plan/dmponline/dmponline/). No idea how to get started? Please contact me!
* You can find the TNW/AS Research Data Management Policy here: https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Library/Themaportalen/RDM/Beleid/2020_AS_Research_Data_Management_Policy.pdf - (please copy-paste the link in the browser to open it if clicking the link doesn’t work, or contact me)

Another external event that you can attend is an [online **ReproHack**](https://n8cir.org.uk/events/remote-reprohack/) on the 14th of May. 
During a ReproHack, participants attempt to reproduce published research of their choice from a list of proposed papers with publicly available associated code and data. 
You can also submit your paper if you would like to see if it can be reproduced, or if you would like some friendly/constructive feedback on your work. 
This is a really fun way to learn a lot about how you can share your data and code in a way so that others are able to find and reproduce your results. 

If you fell asleep from all the information in this email because you’re already aware of everything, please consider to become a **[Data Champion](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/support/data-champions/)** and share the code/data management love.

Please let me know if you need more information about any of these events or about other data management related issues! You can reach me through Skype for Business (also messaging) or e-mail.
