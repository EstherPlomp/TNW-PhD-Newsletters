# Events
* The **Research Software Camp (16-27 May)** kicks off with a panel on [Research software career paths and training needs](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/panel-discussion-research-software-career-paths-and-training-needs-tickets-322597918057) and you can sign up for various workshops to help you take the [Next Steps in Coding](https://www.software.ac.uk/RSCamp-next-steps-coding). 
* On the **18th of May (3:00 - 5:30 pm)** a seminar on [“Women in Data Science - Perspectives in Industry and Academia”](https://www.denbi.de/women-in-data-science/women-in-data-sciences-2022) takes place.
* The DCC spring days are organising a couple of session on **research data management (between 2-23 June)**. 
You can sign up through a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcASgJ6T_1r_sUPvWSihTfCKlbTMtzwk5ar3yAsOBGjCKtKg/viewform). 
Particularly the session in person on anonymisation of personal data (**June 15**) and the session on reproducible workflows (**23 June**) look of interest. 
* [BioSB is organising several courses](https://www.dtls.nl/biosb/courses/) on **bioinformatics and systems biology** in the upcoming months 

# Open Science
*	[The recording]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RHSynVB2Ng) of the **Open Hardware Summit 2022** is available! 
You can watch it to get an idea of the (widespread) applications made possible by Open Hardware. 
Highlights are the keynote by Ashley Jane Lewis ([starting at 5.47](https://youtu.be/3RHSynVB2Ng?t=347)) and the presentation by our own Open Hardware Engineer, Jerry de Vos ([starting at 1:00:07](https://youtu.be/3RHSynVB2Ng?t=3607)). 
Email Jerry (J.deVos-2@tudelft.nl) if you want to know more about Open Hardware at TU Delft! 
* Watch a [video by Cassandra Gould van Praag](https://vimeo.com/670399599) to learn more about **how to get a DOI for your research outputs**. 
[arXiv now also asigns DOIs!](https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/17/new-arxiv-articles-are-now-automatically-assigned-dois/) 
* Watch another [video by Prof Stephen Curry](https://youtu.be/AvXNsp2ch-A) on **Open Research and DORA**.
* To see how others started their **Open Science journeys** and get inspired, watch an [interview with Dr. Malvika Sharan]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMwRyAwnlEk), or a [recording of the eLife Ambassadors Open Science event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XOyGZDCfdg).
* If you are trying to **convince your supervisor** that you want to share your research outputs more widely, Kowalczyk et al. 2022 wrote a paper on [‘What senior academic can do to support open research’]( https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-022-05999-0). There’s also the [ten-week plan for open data science]( https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) that can be used as a starting point. 
* What can you do to **work more openly**? Read [this blogpost]( https://blog.scholasticahq.com/post/oa-leaders-advancing-boai-part-2/ ), especially the part by Dr. Mark C. Wilson who is offering some practical tips (scroll down a bit). 
* Check out the [**Open Science Top Ten Tools**](https://genr.eu/wp/open-science-top-ten-tools-all-open-source/)! 
At TU Delft we also have a [GitLab instance](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/users/sign_in) and you could use [4TU.ResearchData](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/), which is similar to Zenodo mentioned in this blogpost. 

# Research Data Management
* Learn more about **Data Management Plans (DMP)** by [watching a video on DMPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvs5_X5rn8w). 
You will need to write a Data Management Plan for your Go/No-Go (if you started after 1 jan 2020), which you can do through [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/). 
You can also follow the [Research Data Management 101 course]( https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/phd/doctoral-education-programme-de/training-programme/r4a1-research-data-management-101) or contact me for any help. 
* You can also watch Aalto University’s [Introduction to Research Data Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duDCcV8xhQo) if you do not want to follow a full course.
Not everything will be directly relevant as we have TU Delft solutions, but their tips and resources are generally applicable. 
* [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) also has a chapter on [Research Data Management](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm.html) - and a lot more information on how to **work more reproducible**. 
* Read a blogpost on [‘How to **Organize Your Digital Files**’](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-organize-your-digital-files/).
* [Sharing biological data: why, when, and how](https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.14067) by Wilson et al. 2021 provides some pointers on how you can share **biological data**, specifically tabular data, genomics, proteomics, microscopy, and structural biological data. 
* Setting up your **readme file** has never been easier with the [readme.so online editor](https://readme.so/).
