Let Esther know!
* Catch up with [the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or9Bb78_wAg) of a webinar on **Leadership and mentorship for early-career researchers**.
* The **Applied Sciences Open Science Team** is looking for new members! 
The Open Science Team aims to promote Open Science practices at our faculty. 
By joining the team, you can shape the direction that the Faculty is taking towards Open Science. 
Open Science Team member activities can range from facilitating discussions, to working on guiding principles (see below!), setting out a survey and [share the results publicly](https://github.com/M-Sabrina/open_science_survey/tree/main), work on an Open Hardware poster, or organising a session on an Open Science topic for their department. 
The next round will start in the next academic year and will involve participation in four meetings and taking an active role in shaping the related activities for your department. 
GS credits are available for learning on the job. 
If you’re interested in participating, or want to know more, please reach out to Esther!

* The Open Science Team worked on a guidance document with questions that can be asked in assessment conversations (such as the annual review) about Open Science practices. 
Feedback still welcome [in the document itself in track change]( https://tud365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/TNW-OpenScience-OpenScienceTeam/EToV4_Vx5ZJNjJjmNOQYVVgBVg7BQ2RfY7e4OyeSTW3r8A?e=7t66Ob)!
