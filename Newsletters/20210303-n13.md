*	There are two **intermediate programming workshops** coming up organised by the Netherlands eScience Center. 
A workshop on [‘Reproducible Computational Environments Using Containers: an Introduction to Docker’](https://escience-academy.github.io/2021-03-23-containers/) on the **23rd of March** and a [Code Refinery workshop](https://escience-academy.github.io/2021-03-29-code-refine/) from **March 29-April 1.** 
Both registrations open up on the **8th of March**. 
Make sure to register as soon as possible if you would like to join these courses as they are open to anyone in the Netherlands.  

Want to **share your data** but not sure how or why? 
* This blogpost [‘How can you make research data accessible’](https://www.software.ac.uk/how-can-you-make-research-data-accessible) describes five steps that you can take. 
*	Wellcome’s (UK funder) [data sharing guide](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__think.f1000research.com_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_2021_01_Open-5FData-5FJourney.pdf-3Futm-5Fsource-3DCPB-26utm-5Fmedium-3Dcms-26utm-5Fcampaign-3DJPE14618&d=DwMFAg&c=XYzUhXBD2cD-CornpT4QE19xOJBbRy-TBPLK0X9U2o8&r=qx-Tb7sihBJZNL88xMGfB6jQKYzV5t8sRq2LokPa_BE&m=D0DyZjvAEkjnkZIqochhdadHYsGST2pJoXB15H6Ghmc&s=hkXL1bLTIMPvpQnmyByUh5xj8DHCK8AH3CrbOaJcwXs&e=) (pdf) provides a short overview of things you will encounter if you want to share your data and contains a lot of good resources that help you to get started!

*	[5 ways sharing your research data could help enhance your career](https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/the-source/blog/blogposts-open-research/5-ways-sharing-your-research-data-could-help-enhance-your-career/18560392) – Nature blogpost 
*	Once you share your data you need a Data Availability Statement in your article. 
See these [tips from Springer Nature for writing this statement](https://researchdata.springernature.com/posts/tips-for-writing-a-dazzling-das-data-availability-statement).

The [videos of the **2020 Essential Open Source Software for Science conference** are available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6OkCbEd1AE&list=PLilvrWT8aLuZgAIJ7rq3-hhw_M5Z1yV4l). 
See for example the [demo on Imaging & Microscopy](https://youtu.be/0FjKkTJO0Rc).
