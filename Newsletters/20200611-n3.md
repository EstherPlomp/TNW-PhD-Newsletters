Good afternoon!

I hope you’re all still keeping safe and healthy! 
I would like to notify you again of some online events and things related to data management:

Have you shared your data in the past, or do you know someone that has? 
[Nominate](https://researchdata.nl/en/services/data-prize/nomination-form) yourself, another researcher or a research group, for the **Dutch Data Prize**! (deadline extended until the **1st of July**!)

Now is the time to educate yourself about **#BlackLivesMatter**! 
Rebecca Sloot’s ‘The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks’ (book or documentary!) will give you some insight on how science is political and has a history of inequality and discrimination (recommendation found through a tweet from Charlotte Koster from BT). 
You can also read up on your privileges through Tatiana Mac’s [White Guyde to the Galaxy](https://tatianamac.com/posts/white-guyde) or [Save the Tears: White Woman's Guide](https://tatianamac.com/posts/save-the-tears/). For the rest; hang in there. 

[This Twitter post on “What is the Secret to **Developing New Research Ideas**?”](https://twitter.com/GeostatsGuy/status/1267114162284630018) may give you some new ideas if you’re stuck.  

If you’re a **Python user** and you want to keep up with the latest developments, [sign up for Tony Hirst’s newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/TrackingJupyter). 
See also [this newly released Python course](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/) if you want to improve your skills. 

If you’re an **R user**, you may want to sign up for the [European R Users Meeting](https://2020.erum.io/#erumgoesvirtual) that takes place from **17-20 June**. 

Interested in **Publishing in Open Science** and want to have a say? 
Eurodoc (the European Council for Doctoral Candidates and Junior Researchers) launched a [7 min survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/EurodocSurveyPublishingOpenScience2020) on the topic.

The National **Open Science Festival** (postponed to next year) is organising an online event on the 2nd of July where Open Science Use Cases are presented (with our very own André Melo, Sebastian Rubbert, and Anton Akhmerov from QN), as well as some virtual network drinks. 
You can [find more information and sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-online-session-1-open-science-use-case-awards-107677789166).

The [online workshop series “Strategies to overcome your challenges in **multi-omics** data integration”](https://x-omics.nl/all-events/online-workshop-series-strategies-to-overcome-your-challenges-in-multi-omics-data-integration/individual-registration 
) will run between **18-30 June**. 

Please let me know if you need more information about any of these events/calls or about other data management related issues! You can reach me through Skype for Business (also messaging) or e-mail.
