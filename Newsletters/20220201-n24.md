This newsletter contains some items that have closing deadlines (programming workshops!) and some career information which is not always directly related to Open Science but still important to consider. 
If you’d like to learn more about any data/software/Open Science positions that are out there, please do reach out or [read more about this research infrastructure roles on the Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles.html)!

# Programming workshops
* RIOT is organising a [GitHub version control workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/version-control-for-academics-with-github-tickets-250158429597) **today at 15:00-16:00.** 
[RIOT has a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RIOTScienceClub) on which they place recordings of their workshops and interesting talks, so hopefully you can (re)watch it later!
* The Netherlands eScience Center is organising an online workshop on “**GPU programming**” in the mornings of **8-9 February** (9:00-13:00). 
**[Register today!](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/gpu-programming-tickets-249619076377)** 
You need basic skills in Python (and preferably NumPy), and the ability to read and understand C code.
* The Netherlands eScience Center is organising an **intermediate programming workshop on “How to write good code (Code Refinery)”** in the mornings of **14-17 February** (9:00-13:00). 
The [registrations are sold out but you can still join the waiting list](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-refinery-tickets-254400086507) (which will hopefully also keep you in the loop of any future editions). Some experience in navigating file trees and editing files in a terminal session, as well as basic knowledge of Python programming is recommended.
