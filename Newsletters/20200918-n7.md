Good morning!

I hope your start of the academic year is going as smooth as it possibly can at the moment. 
Below you can find more info on research data/code management and open science related things:

Do you want to learn more about **research data management** and earn Graduate School Credits? 
The Graduate School is now offering the [Research Data Management 101 course](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/r4.a1-research-data-management-101). 
If you do not want to follow a course you can also see [this webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCUT6MA-zVA) (+ [slides](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:28833/)). 
Some resources mentioned in the webinar are Cambridge specific, but most info is relevant for anyone. 
TU Delft resources include the [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/) archive to share your data, [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) to set up a data management plan (use your netID to login!) or the [project drive](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/manage/storage/) to store your project’s research data. 

Are you considering joining **Twitter** but you do not have any idea where to start? 
There is a [guide on Twitter for scientists](https://t4scientists.com/). 
I recommend it to extend your network, learn about events that I’m not forwarding, and see nice Twitter threads like [this one on reproducibility](https://twitter.com/VLucet/status/1297928408077303809) (with gifs!). 
See also [this thread on mental health](https://twitter.com/MIKendrick94/status/1301338644934877186) during COVID. 
You can also follow the [Open Research Calendar](https://twitter.com/openresearchcal) for Open Science related events!

Want to learn more about **file formats**? Watch this [short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxxlQnc8u1I).

Do you have a brilliant idea for how science and technology can improve societies efforts towards sustainability? 
The **[CEASAER ‘Best Idea 2021 Competition’](https://www.cesaer.org/news/best-idea-2021/)** provides you with the opportunity to win 20.000 euro for your team. 
The deadline for submission of abstracts is **31 January 2021**.

Applications are open until **September 30th for the [2021 BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/applications-open-for-the-2021-bssw-fellowship-program)**, which gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific **software**. 

Are you working in **-omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics)**? Join the online [X-omics festival “The future is now!”](https://x-omics.nl/festival) on **28th of September** (09.30 – 14.00).

Struggling with **managing your references** in your papers/thesis? Watch this [short video on Zotero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JItohgzhDkY), a reference manager. 

If you believe that working hard will bring you success in your PhD (or life), you may want to watch this [12 min video on how luck also plays a role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I). 

Before **sharing your code** it is good to use a quality checklist (see the [FAIR software recommendations](https://fair-software.nl/recommendations/checklist)). 
You can use the [Software Sustainability Institute checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform) (it is a google form), the [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform) one, or the [EURISE guide](https://github.com/eurise-network/technical-reference/blob/v0.1/quality/software-checklist.rst). 
Looking for more information on how to manage/share your code/software? 
The [eScience Center has a guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/) on this and [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) provides lots of useful information on software/data management information. 

eLife released a **new article format**: [Executable Research Article](https://elifesciences.org/labs/dc5acbde/welcome-to-a-new-era-of-reproducible-publishing). 
This format allows for live code, data and interactive figures next to your manuscript.

As always, if you have any questions about any of this information or about other open science/data/software related stuff: Please feel free to get in touch!

Have a good weekend!
