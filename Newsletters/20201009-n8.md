Good afternoon!

Please find below some info on research data/code management and open science related events, calls and information:

**Coding workshops**: 
* There is a workshop on reproducible data science in **R** on the 10th of November organised by RIOTSclub/ReproducibiliTea ([Registration](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/improve-your-workflow-for-reproducible-science-tickets-123308794925)). 
* You can also follow the [Open **R** Stream](http://www.wvbauer.com/doku.php/live_streams) on Twitch to learn more about R. 
* If you missed the registrations for the October **Code Refinery** workshop (intermediate coding workshop), the eScience Center is organising the same [Code Refinery course in November (16-19)](https://escience-academy.github.io/2020/11/16/Code-Refinery.html). 
This is an intermediate coding workshop that focuses on working more reproducible. 

Did you just **start your PhD**? 
The TU Delft graduate school is now offering a course on [‘**Research Data Management** 101’](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/r4.a1-research-data-management-101)! 
The [PhD on track website](https://www.phdontrack.net/) has some resources that could be useful. 
You can also read Alexandra Lautarescu’s [blogpost on the tools](https://www.alautarescu.com/post/what-i-use-during-my-phd) she is using during her PhD or Sam Westwood’s [blogpost on ‘Time-saving things that actually work’](https://medium.com/@samuelwestwood/time-saving-things-that-actually-work-trust-me-28461a6f4a41?source=linkShare-60ad664054ea-1601025564).

The Netherlands eScience Center awards €50,000 worth of expertise to a **novel research idea**. 
Together with the eScience Center’s experts you will turn your idea into a full project description. 
[Submit your idea](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/collaborate/young-escientist-award-2020/) before **November 30, 2020**! 

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is organising an online event to contribute to their book. 
It is a great community that works on increasing the **reproducibility of data science** and it is an amazing opportunity to learn how to work on **GitHub**. 
Fill out their [Google Doc form to send in an application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO9VygL0W-DAybeI2Nt8xWK4c2kWyQfHnqwwZPLptWNf6H3Q/viewform) before the **22nd of October**. 
(They are also participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) if you’re interested in a Tshirt!). 

After the spreadsheet mess with the corona cases in the UK it may be good to have a look at your own spreadsheets. 
You can use [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/)/[Frictionlessdata](https://frictionlessdata.io/)/[Excelint](https://github.com/plasma-umass/Excelint-addin) to **organise your spreadsheet data** (see also [this lesson on OpenRefine by the Carpentries](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/)).

MDPI Crystals will launch a Special Issue on the topic **Protein Design** in Medicine. 
They are currently looking for Guest Editors that could assist in the outreach process and to join discussions with the Editor. 
This is a great opportunity for you have some knowledge about Protein Design and if you’re more at the end of your PhD and would like to get some editing experiences. 
Please get in touch if you’re interested.

To avoid publishing with **predatory publishers** check out the checklists for [books](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/books-and-chapters/) and [journals](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) from [Think, check, submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/).

If you didn’t have weekend plans yet and want to learn more about racism in the Netherlands/Europe you can watch the documentary [‘The Uprising’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GjRMQrJ2ig) or listen to the [podcast ‘Reproducible data science, how hard can it be?’](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1OVxFUA5UyIfMSCd842wjD?si=tEhJzufDROmOqsvJHsUPuw). 
If you saw no problem with the recent Safra et al. paper about trustworthiness of facial cues, you should have a look at [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14258) (arXiv:2009.14258) by Birhane and Guest.

As always, if you have any questions about any of this information or about other open science/data/software related stuff: Please feel free to get in touch!

Have a good weekend!
