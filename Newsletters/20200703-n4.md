Good afternoon!

I would like to update you again on some data management related events and information: 

If you want to learn more about how you can **share your data with your publication**, CODATA hosted an excellent webinar on the topic. 
You can [listen to the recording](https://codata.org/initiatives/strategic-programme/codata-connect/webinar-series-research-skills/webinar-2-writing-an-article-with-excellent-supporting-data/). 
You can also find some guidance I set up on [how to cite data in your paper](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/fXtBM6YyHPRTdLb).  

Next week the round table discussion ‘**The Cost of Correcting Bad Science**’ will take place on the **8th of July** (15:30-18:00). 
See the [event page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-cost-of-correcting-bad-science-tickets-109044292414?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch) for more information. 

In case you missed the **Binder** workshop in June, all the [materials are available on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder). 

PhD balance organises a session on **PhD issues** every Saturday evening. 
See their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI1kMS6Sm61xJAJCGqp6Pqw) for the recordings on for example [adapting to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4FAqvGrAHE) and [standing up for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnyIzEFHXqI).
If you want to share your experiences you can contact them to get on the podcast/show yourself! 

You can join a virtual **course on algorithmic theory and bioinformatics** (19-23 October 2020). [Send in an application](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/our-events/next-generation-sequencing-bioinformatics-2020/) before the 13th of August. 

Not sure how to **make your computational workflow more reproducible**? Find some tips to start on the [Aalto Scientific Computing website](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/zen-of-scicomp/). 

If you are still **unable to do your lab work**, or are limited in your lab time, [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eao-3S3WAAcA8kK?format=png&name=900x900) are some ideas to use your time creatively.

If you need some peer pressure to **get some writing done**, PhD Forum is organising shared virtual writing session. 
You can check their [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/dr-donna-peach-phdforum-30416310132) for the timings of these sessions. 
[The next one](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/phdforum-virtual-writing-portal-8-july-tickets-111120185466) will take place on the 8th of July from 7:00 to 15:00 (you don’t have to join the whole day of course). 

The [**Open Chemical Science conference**](https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/42090/open-chemical-science) will take place online from the 9-13th of November in the form of three workshops on Open Access, Data and Open Source Tools.

Please let me know if you need more information about any of these events or about other data management related issues! You can reach me through Skype for Business/Teams (also messaging) or e-mail.

Enjoy the weekend!
