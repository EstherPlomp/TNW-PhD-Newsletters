# Open Science Course:
* The next round of applications for the [Open Life Science programme](https://openlifesci.org) is now open and will close on **7 July**! 
Although the title says Life Sciences, it is open to a wide range of disciplines. 
* By participating in this 16 week course you will learn all about **Open Science principles and practices** and to top that: [receive 5 GS discipline specific credits](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme)! 
(Please note that the intranet page needs to be updated, so the deadlines and Zoom information there are outdated).
More information from the Faculty Graduate School will follow.
* You can attend an **introduction webinar** to learn more about the programme and ask all your questions on **29 June (9:30-10:30 via Zoom - https://tudelft.zoom.us/j/96295679311?pwd=U1B5SHZLeUhPakZQYmJEeVhmZEV3dz09)**. 
  * A recording from a previous webinar is available on the [Open Life Science YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksUzRDFn20&feature=youtu.be).
* If you have any doubts whether you would like to participate, please get in touch!

# Events & Opportunities
* SURF and the eSciencecenter are organising a [course on using **Julia for high-performance computing** and data analysis](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda/julia-for-hpc) on the **23 June** (14:00-17:00).
* TU Delft **Open Hardware** is organising a 10 week programme to learn about open source and make your own project available online: the Open Hardware Acadamy. 
Learn more about this on **24 June** (14:30-16:30) during the [information event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/announcing-the-open-hardware-academy-tickets-351094893277).
* The **Dutch national interest organisation for PhD candidates (PNN)** is [looking for board members](https://hetpnn.nl/en/vacatures/). 
Apply until **10 July** to start in September. 
* If you’re working with **imaging/microscopy** and associated analysis (especially if you’re just starting!), please fill out [a survey by the Center for Open Bioimage Analysis](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaqL5EA94TDHOVUFOgARc5w6WSoeQoIOD0N81feVwyZFUemg/viewform). 

# Programming skills
*	Not sure **where to start with programming**? Check out the following blog posts:
    * [Resources for using spreadsheets in research and moving to other tools](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2021-11-05-resources-using-spreadsheets-research-and-moving-other-tools)
    * [9 Reasons Excel Users Should Consider Learning Programming](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/9-reasons-excel-users-should-consider-learning-programming/)
    * [Training resources for researchers who want to code](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2021-11-11-training-resources-researchers-want-learn-code) 
    * [Top Tips to Start Coding in Academia](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2021-11-04-top-tips-start-coding-academia)
* Follow an [introduction to version control with **GitLab**](https://vimeo.com/668637653) by Dr Cassandra Gould van Praag. 
[TU Delft has its own instance of GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/) that is meant particularly for sensitive data/code that cannot be shared externally. 
If you have external collaborators in a project, GitHub is a better solution. 
* Watch a 3 minute video on [How can **software containers** help your research?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HelrQnm3v4g)
* For more **intermediate/advanced programming** there are some resources to learn how to write cleaner code: 
  * Slides (.pdf) on [Writing clear code](https://kbroman.org/AdvData/14_clearcode.pdf) by Karl Broman
  * Presentation on [Code Smells and Feels](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels#readme) by Jenny Bryan
  * Slides on [Writing Clean Scientific Software](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3922957) by Nicolas Murphy 
  * Example [video of how to structure your code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQIOyF2oots) by Anton Akhmerov
  * [15 tips to write better analytic code](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13362740.v1) by Francisco Rodriguez-Sanchez
* You can also learn how to improve your **software management** from [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/index.html).
* If you have some time to read a **book on programming**, Felienne Hermans wrote [The Programmer's Brain](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-output/science/the-programmers-brain).
* TU Delft is also organising several **programming workshops**. 
You can find more information on the [library website]( https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/). 
  * The next Code Refinery will take place in September, for example. 
If you cannot make this, there are also [CodeRefinery recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJABxMUsrXAM4g8i2d9W4oyft).

With the summer coming up it can be helpful to prioritise taking it easy. Listen to two podcasts on: 
* [The Guide to Saying No](https://www.deargradstudent.com/episodes/64) (starts at 9:30)
* [Not overextending ourselves](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2WrDeT1u4XjkANRJz7C5Pm?si=d6d74ea5466d46fb)
