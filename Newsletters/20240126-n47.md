Any Open Science Community Delft community member can apply ([join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2Cha-gy0J5mLzMvlTjT66XLn-c0TBo5FxYG0-JC9TE5aMBw/viewform) if you’re not a member yet!). 
Check the [website for more information](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/open-science/articles-tu-delft/mainstreaming-open-science-fund-2024) or get in touch with any questions!
* **Linux user group TU Delft** has set up a [Linux Q&A Portal](https://linux.ewi.tudelft.nl/) and a [mattermost channel](https://mattermost.tudelft.nl/linux-user-group/) to exchange experiences! 
(Use the mattermost [join link](https://mattermost.tudelft.nl/signup_user_complete/?id=s6gwfjstkjfsxc3o4kw16as9ur&md=link&sbr=fa) or contact Masha Rudneva if you want to be added).
* **SURFdrive** has been [extended from 500 GB to 1 TB](https://www.surf.nl/en/news/surfdrives-birthday-treat-storage-doubles-from-500gb-to-1tb?trk=feed_main-feed-card_reshare_feed-article-content)! 
That means that there is now little difference between using SURFdrive and OneDrive, which also allows for 1 TB of storage!
