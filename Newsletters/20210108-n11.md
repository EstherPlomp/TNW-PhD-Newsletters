Happy New Year! 
Finger’s crossed that this week’s events are not an omen for the rest of the year. 
I hope you were able to disconnect and recharge over the holiday period! 
As usual, please find below some info on research data/code management and open science related events and information. 
You can now also view the [older newsletters on GitHub](https://github.com/EstherPlomp/TNW-PhD-Newsletters/tree/main/Newsletters).

The **Open Science Community Delft** now has a [website](https://osc-delft.github.io/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OSCDelft) account! 
(If you’re not convinced about joining Twitter, there is [some evidence that if you promote your work on Twitter it will increase your citations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.065), so hop on board!) 
You can join the Open Science Community Delft by [filling in a Teams form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIe5b6siKuJadBi47i1ux3Gu1UQ1BZV1JJSk9WQlY3MUJHWllJRUpXR0NJSS4u) (you have to login for this). 
You don’t have to be an expert to join the community! 

If you want to delve more into **Open Science**:
* Watch this video on [five things that you should know about Open Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uCG3Fl6ugE&feature=youtu.be)
* Watch this video on how to become an [Open Science Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV1aFnPkUSI) by Heidi Seibold. 
[Heidi is launching an ‘Open Science Stories’ podcast](https://twitter.com/HeidiBaya/status/1346372717562347523), so if you have any stories that you would like to share, get in touch! 
* The [Passport For Open Science](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/passport-for-open-science-a-practical-guide-for-phd-students/?mc_cid=0abeb12a98&mc_eid=3f2684c619) is a guide for PhD students on Open Access, Data Management, and Reproducibility ([click here to download the pdf directly](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Passport-for-Open-Science-A-Practical-Guide-For-PhD-Students_30-10-2020_WEB.pdf)). 
(The authors are French but in general the resources will also be applicable to you, or there are TU Delft/Dutch alternatives available such as [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/) - email me for more info!). 
* To learn more about Open Access, read [‘A Researcher’s Guide to Open Access Publishing’](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/12/eur-oa/). 
* Read more about [open and reproducible research in this blogpost/presentation](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-rr-2/) by Laurent Gatto. 
* If you’re not convinced about the importance of Open Science/Data Management, you can watch these seminars on ‘[Science as Amateur Software Development](https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY)’ and ‘[Food for Psychologists](https://youtu.be/s4-stjwnQxE)’ (which are both applicable to any discipline working with data/code).

[Registration is now open for rstudio::global(2021)](https://rstudio.com/conference/), a 24-hour virtual event on the **21st of Jan** focused on all things **R and RStudio**. 
You can also get started with R using the materials from the ‘[R for Excel users](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/conf20-r-excel/)’ course. 

**Python** beginners may find the materials from the ‘[Data Science in Python course](https://github.com/semacu/data-science-python)’ of interest. 
You can now also use emojis in Python: [pip install emoji](https://twitter.com/pybites/status/1323488121158356992). 
Other handy Python libraries are [SMOP, a Matlab to Python compiler](https://github.com/victorlei/smop) and [spec2vec](https://github.com/iomega/spec2vec) for mass spectrometry data. 

Heard about **Docker** as a way to share your code but didn’t try it yet? 
Read two short blogposts if you [want to start using Docker](https://blog.datasciencedojo.com/data-science-with-docker-containers/) and ensure that [what you share with Docker becomes citable](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-12-reproducible-research-citing-your-execution-environment-using-docker-and-doi). 

**Zotero**, a reference manager tool, also allows you to [annotate pdf’s and extract those annotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faYJ4gEGZ40&feature=youtu.be)!
See also [this blogpost on how Zotero can make your writing life easier](https://daily.jstor.org/how-to-use-zotero-and-scrivener-for-research-driven-writing/). 
**[Draftable](https://draftable.com/)** allows you to compare pdf’s (in case you want to go over the pdf proofs of a paper).

You can also check out [SciTLDR](https://scitldr.apps.allenai.org/): a tool that summarises papers in one sentence! 
That leaves you with some more time to watch [John Oliver’s Last week Tonight on Scientific Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw) (from 2016) if you want to have a laugh. 
You can also listen to [the Scientistt podcast](https://scientistt.net/pages/podcast) if you want to hear more about the realities of research life (in case you cannot get enough ;)).
