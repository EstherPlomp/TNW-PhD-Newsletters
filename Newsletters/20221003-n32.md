# Software
*	Learning **Python**? 
    * Check out the [Python Cheat sheet by OpenAcademics](https://twitter.com/OpenAcademics/status/1522246807765458944)
    *	Go over the source code from **Machine Learning Projects** for beginners [via a thread by Aishwarya Nevrekar](https://twitter.com/nevrekaraishwa2/status/1555232126240698368). 
 Or follow a [course that introduces Machine Learning](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/introduction-machine-learning).
    *	Read the book ‘[Python for data analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)’ 
    *	Or another book on ‘[Research Software Engineering with Python](https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/)’
    *	Check the course ‘[Programming in Python for Data Science](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/programming-in-python-for-data-science)’

*	Want to learn more about making your code/project **reproducible**? 
    *	Read a chapter about ‘[Reproducible Bioinformatics Research for Biologists](https://osf.io/zqbu2)’ (for anyone with more wetlab experience than programming!)
    *	Follow a [reproducibility checklist (pdf)](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist-v1.2.pdf) set up by NeurIPS.
    *	Check out [slides by Jason K. Moore on computational reproducible papers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQDdWrp6zgVY1RodVLECVI0D7leP5eAeJLUD6ZHuX_NA-jvfWKTXcWHv9mZjR6W0PxPmmaJgFMpxIqJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.p). 
    *	Watch some videos/seminars: 
        *	‘[Towards a Culture of Computational Reproducibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjW3t-qXAiE&)’
        *	‘[Steps towards reproducible research]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNQ-RlG3JnQ)’
        *	[How to make your research reproducible?](https://www.workcast.com/ControlUsher.aspx?cpak=8232371292435174&pak=7279159888532687) (requires you to register to watch on demand)

Or if you need to procrastinate, listen to the [Data Horror song](https://twitter.com/rafamoral/status/1571622591219236864)! 
If you then want to **Get things Done**, read a [Twitter thread by Benjamin Smith](https://twitter.com/itmebenji/status/1559170545718947843).
