Please nominate yourself or someone you know for the Convergence Health and Technology Open Research Award!

The next **eScienceCenter basic programming workshop** will be held online on **September 6-9**. 
Check their [workshop website for updates](https://escience-academy.github.io/2021/09/06/swc-py-nlesc.html) (registration is not open yet). 
Note that this workshop is not organised by TU Delft, but the contents are very similar to our basic programming workshops.
