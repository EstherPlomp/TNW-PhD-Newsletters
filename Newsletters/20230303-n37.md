* [Learn all about preprints from Jessica Polka](https://youtu.be/TW-SrGkmH6U?t=199) or check a webinar on '[How to Publish Preprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwtX3kmnC4c)'. 
* Not convinced about preprints? Check out a video on [How preprints can benefit both science and your career](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-5YnAcN6Aw) or read [a guide to preprinting for early-career researchers](https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.059310) that lists benefits and arguments to convince co-authors to preprint. 
* What if we all just submitted preprints and [have the journals compete on what gets published](https://twitter.com/DrCMcMaster/status/1515476892782317571?t=KV926aFHvKuOqzIcoCacdA&s=03)? 

# Personal Data
* **Personal Data** is any data that can lead to the identification of a person. 
If you work with surveys, interviews or videos of people – you’re working with personal data. 
This requires extra care when managing the data. 
See for example the [data privacy strategies outlined by The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpm/data-privacy-strategies.html).
* TU Delft now has a self-paced **personal data course**. 
You can sign up and follow it for 0.5 GS credits. 
The next run starts **3 April**. See the [website for more information](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/personal-data-human-subjects-in-research).
* If you want to learn more about the laws that regulate processing of personal data, such as the **GDPR**, you can watch a talk on ‘[GDPR & processing of (identifiable) image, audio, and video data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2mv6q4WwOU)’ or ‘[Putting Data Protection into practice](https://youtu.be/eAKhI0qde2w?t=1110)’ (18:30-38:50). 
Or if you’re working with any **clinical data**: ‘[Open Data and Data Management in Clinical Research]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7YtnrLPG_A)’.
