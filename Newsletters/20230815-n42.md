-	Learn more about **Open Science and FAIR data** at the joint networking event for the Open Science Community Delft and 4TU.ResearchData on **14 September**.
There’s a walk-in lunch at 12.30! [Register via Eventbrite]( https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-and-fair-community-event-tickets-648924519707).
-	Save the date for [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) BookDash in November (**13-19 November**).
During this event you can contribute to an open source book focused on **reproducible and ethical data science** and join a community of contributors. 

# Software / Programming 
-	The next Code Refinery workshop (intermediate programming) is coming up in **September** (19-21 & 26-28, 6 half days, online and limited in person spots).
Keep an eye on the [library website]( https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/coderefinery-workshops) to see if the registration website is updated!
-	This year’s **JupyterCon videos** are [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JupyterCon/videos).
See for example the presentation by Franklin Koch on [MyST Markdown: Using notebooks in scientific publishing workflows]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyRmcbWBXs4).
(You can also check out the [Start using MyST Markdown in JupyterLab in 30 seconds video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM0IMVPH9AU)). 
-	Read up on **reproducible and FAIR software** via a [blogpost by Peter Kalverla](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/6-months-of-escience-6-lessons-worth-sharing-4fc925a1e376).
-	Learn more about **version control** in this blogpost on [Why mycode.R_final.v2_usethisone is not helping your workflow](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-06-05-why-mycoderfinalv2usethisone-not-helping-your-workflow).
-	If you want to work more collaboratively using version control you can consider using **GitHub or TU Delft GitLab**.
  [TU Delft GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/) is intended for private/secure repositories, whereas [GitHub](https://github.com/) is easier to use if you do not work with sensitive code and need to collaborate with externals. 
    - Learn more about Git and GitHub via [Perez-Riverol et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947)
    - You can generate the text for your GitHub profile using [profilinator](https://profilinator.rishav.dev/) or the [GitHub Profile Readme Generator](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/)
    - You can also implement GitHub Actions to check for errors in your data processing and cleaning: see [Kim et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13982) for more details.
- You can check out a webinar on [Practicals: Scientific software engineering principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTjgTj6k5kE), where the first talk focuses on **version control** and the last one on **testing**.
- For more resources on **testing**, check out another webinar on [Software Testing in Open Source and Data Science (Eric Ma)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJGgVoV4GTc)
- Read up on the [Top ten reasons to not **share your code** (and why you should anyway)](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/top-ten-reasons-to-not-share-your-code-and-why-you-should-anyway)
- Learn more about **code review** in a [webinar by Lisa DeBruine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w056yEMyJnE)


And if you’re interested in moving from a closed to **open source version of social media: Mastodon** might be for you! See the [blog by Danielle Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/), the [How to Join Mastodon blogpost]( https://gizmodo.com/how-to-join-mastodon-twitter-alternative-elon-musk-1849739031), or another [blogpost by Stammy](https://paulstamatiou.com/mastodon/). 
[SURF also hosts a pilot](https://www.surf.nl/en/mastodon-pilot-for-research-and-education) which is making it easy to join their instance and get started!
