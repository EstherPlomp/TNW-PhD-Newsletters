# New Data Steward update

False alarm regarding possible slower support (as announced in the last newsletter)! 
We will have a **new Data Steward** starting at the faculty on **1 November** – so **no support gap** is expected! 
The next newsletter will contain an introduction to our new Data Steward and their contact details.
