# Open Science Team 
-	The Faculty's Open Science Team is looking for new members! We are especially looking for **PhD candidates based at BN and BT**. 
-	The Open Science Team aims to promote Open Science practices at our faculty. By joining the team, you can shape the direction that the Faculty is taking towards Open Science. Open Science Team member activities can range from facilitating discussions, to working on guiding principles, or organising a session on an Open Science topic for their department. The next round will start in the next academic year (August/September 2023 – June/July 2024) and will involve some meetings and taking an active role in shaping the related activities for your department.
-	To express your interest in becoming a team member or to learn more about the Open Science Team, please email Esther. 

# Courses
Expression of interest for **Research Data Management 101** course:
-	As mentioned by an earlier email (on 27 June) from the Faculty Graduate School: The [Research Data Management 101 course](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101), offered via the central Graduate School (GS), is very popular and has a long waiting list. 
-	You can still fill out **the form** to indicate your interest for the Research Data Management 101 course in September/October **before 6 July 17:00**.
-	Note that at this point you’re likely to be added to the waiting list rather than securing a spot for the next run of the course. 
-	This course is particularly relevant for **first year PhDs** and includes setting up a Data Management Plan (one of the requirements for the Go-No/Go!).

**Reminder: Open Science Course**
-	The next round of applications for [Open Seeds](https://openlifesci.org/) (or OLS-8) is open until **7 July** and the information session takes place online **today**, **3 July 16:00**!
-	By participating in this 16 week course (September 2023 - January 2024, with a flexible schedule!) you will learn all about **Open Science principles and practices** and to top that: receive 5 GS discipline specific credits!
-	Please see [intranet](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme) for more information.
-	If you have any doubts whether you would like to participate, please get in touch with Esther!

# Events & Opportunities
-	The eLife Ambassadors are hosting [events for early career researchers](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIod-mgpzsiHNBo1iJERsD6yS3xiqfw6qmz#/registration) on **19 July** and **16 of August**, focusing on **health and wellbeing**. 
-	Save the date for the launch symposium of the **Dutch Reproducibility Network** ([NLRN](http://reproducibilitynetwork.nl/)), taking place **27 October** in Amsterdam.
-	**Reminder for ChemE PhD candidates**: If you'd like to participate in an 1 hour interview about Open Data with Nitin, please contact him directly.

# Programming / code
- Looking for something to read over the summer?
How about [The Programmers Brain](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain) by Felienne Hermans.
It contains helpful information and tips about **improving your programming brain and skills**!
- See also this [List of Free **Learning Resources** In Many Languages](https://ebookfoundation.github.io/free-programming-books/) or learn more about [Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).
- Check course materials on [Writing **Reusable and Modular Code**](https://uf-repro.github.io/writing-reusable-code/).
- You may also want to try out **Quarto**. [Quarto offers features that are especially useful for academics](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2023-05-22-quarto-for-academics).
- Read up on why you should [**comment** your code as little (and as well) as possible](https://blog.r-hub.io/2023/01/26/code-comments-self-explaining-code/).
- Learn more about **software licencing** via a [FAQ](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/legal/faq.en.html) or a [podcast by ByteSized](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ev4QCsY4yIoXkAkhEbiVR?si=ed690dac653b43b1).
