I hope you're being kind to yourself in this strange period, where we seem to reach the end of a pandemic only to jump into a world war and discrimination accross borders..

# Publishing and Preprints
* Two videos on the [workings of the publishing system](https://twitter.com/dglaucomflecken/status/1493946227985059841?s=21) and [article processing fees from Nature](https://twitter.com/dglaucomflecken/status/1484679759829209090) by Dr. Glaucomflecken were quite the hit on Twitter in the past month.
* In related news, [publishers now also tag PDFs with a unique hash](https://twitter.com/json_dirs/status/1486120144141123584), so you may want to be careful with how you share articles that are not Open Access (and publish Open Access where you can!)
* A way to make the submitted version of your article openly accessible are **preprints**! If you haven't heard about those yet, here are a couple of resources: 
  * [On Preprints](http://academiclifehistories.weebly.com/blog/on-preprints)
  * eLife now only reviews and publishes articles that are shared as a preprint. 
    Read more about how this works in their [guide for authors](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/fa9de0e7/preprint-review-a-guide-for-authors)
  * Having doubts about posting a preprint? 
    Read a [blogpost about experience with sharing a first preprint](https://veronikach.com/phd-advice/firsts-publishing-a-preprint-before-submitting-the-paper/) or ["Why do some researchers have reservations about preprints?"](https://asapbio.org/march-community-call)
  * Or watch [Preprints: A Practical Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OPpGdZhL5o)


# PhD resources
