When was the last time you considered how to **name your files**? 
Do you run into [New_Final_FINAL_NEW_23_FuckingFinal.jpeg](https://twitter.com/chazhutton/status/1285955514241875968) troubles? 
Have a look at [this presentation on naming things](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) or a [blogpost on how to make your files more findable](https://zapier.com/blog/organize-files-folders/). 
Want to rename multiple files? 
The [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) may save you a lot of time (but be careful with overwriting things)! 
This [short data organisation/documentation manual](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/J6XOVPcUot1tiUl) can help you with file naming but also folder organisation. 
The [‘Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects’](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) is relevant to all research projects and also goes into a bit more detail on **how to organise your files**. 

The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) released a recording of their quite practical webinar on [‘Leveraging Open Ecosystems to Enhance Reproducible Workflows’](https://youtu.be/z9QpLYMM1aQ). 
They demonstrate **how to use the Open Science Framework in combination with [Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/), Python and R**.

If you don't know how a **mathematical symbol** is called you can [draw it on the Detexify website](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) that will provide you with potential names and LaTeX code!

On the lookout for a **career outside of academia**? 
This [Twitter thread lists some job skills](https://twitter.com/ZJAyres/status/1354704980838637569?s=03) that your PhD provides you with! 
See also this [blogpost on the skill gaps of PhD graduates](https://leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/skill-gaps-of-phd-graduates). 

Are you **losing confidence** in yourself or your PhD project?
