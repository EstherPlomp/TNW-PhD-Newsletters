# Course: RDM101 
There are a couple of places left for the first Faculty **Research Data Management 101 course** in 2024, with mandatory in-person sessions in the afternoons of **15 February and 12 March**:
The [Research Data Management 101 course](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) is particularly relevant for **first year PhDs** and includes setting up a Data Management Plan (one of the requirements you’ll have to complete for your Go-No/Go!). 

Main differences between the central and faculty version of the course:

* The faculty version will have two sessions rather than three 
* For the self-paced parts we will not use Brightspace, but a website/GitHub
* The main materials, assignments, and credits you'll receive are the same (1.5 credits for **Research Skills**)

Please fill out [the form](URL) to **indicate your interest. This is not a registration yet!** 
(So please don’t deregister from the central course if you’re registered). 
You’ll be contacted when you are registered. 
Registrations will come on a first-come-first-served basis, and you will be automatically placed on a waiting list for a future edition if you're not included in the upcoming course.
