Good afternoon!

As usual, please find below some info on research data/code management and open science related events and information. 
You can now also find some more info on the [topics you can contact me for on the Applied Sciences Data Stewardship intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/data-stewardship-at-applied-sciences). 

There are a couple of **data/code events and calls** coming up: 
*	If you've got questions about **data/code sharing**, join the [ROpenSci webinar “The Wild World of Data Repositories”](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/dec2020-datarepos/) on the **16th of Dec** (19:00-20:00)!
*	The **TU Delft Digital Competence Center** is opening up their call for project support requests again. 
Learn more about what [type of data/code support the DCC offers on their website](https://dcc.tudelft.nl/). 
You can also find the [application form and criteria for acceptance there](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/libraryfor-researchers/library-for-researchers/setting-up-research/dcc/apply-for-support/) (deadline is **8th of Jan 2021**). 
*	The Data Carpentry **programming workshop** (Introduction to **R**, spreadsheets, OpenRefine) that we organise in **January** will be open for registration next week! 
Drop an email if you’re interested or sign yourself up for our programming workshop waiting list to receive the latest updates: [https://tinyurl.com/CarpentrywaitinglistTUD](https://tinyurl.com/CarpentrywaitinglistTUD) 
*	The UK’s Software Sustainability Institute is hosting a **Research Software Camp (22 February to 5 March)**, focusing on research accessibility. 
You can find [more information about the software camp and indicate your interest on their website](https://www.software.ac.uk/news/register-your-interest-ssis-research-software-camp-research-accessibility).

Do you work with **qualitative research**? [This webinar on transparency and data sharing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKkExQfwqpU) is made for you. 

If you’re **stuck with writing**, this [webinar on “the art of productivity”](https://reachthenextlevel.net/art-productivity/) might help you to get unstuck. 
In sum: You should be realistic about your expectations, block time for writing and stick to it! 
The [PhD Forum is still hosting a writing room](https://www.thephdforum.com/study-room) if you need some accountability. 
Grogan (2020)’s “Writing Science: [What makes scientific writing hard and how to make it easier](https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1800)” also contains some valuable writing tips!

This [blog on managing your supervisor relationship](https://voicesofacademia.com/2020/11/20/managing-your-student-supervisor-relationship-to-support-well-being-by-christiane-whitehouse/) contains some practical tips on **time/boundary management** that comes in handy not just with your supervisor but with anyone you’ll have to collaborate with.

If you want to learn more about **open science** or if you would like to share your expertise, please [join the Open Science Community Delft](https://bit.ly/join-openscience-delft)! 
(The link sends you to a Teams form that requires you to log in before you can see it.) 
You can learn more about the community on the [Open Science Community Delft website](https://osc-delft.github.io/) or get in touch with Emmy Tsang (F.Tsang@tudelft.nl, see also the CC).

The **[Dutch Promovendi Network (PNN)](hetpnn.nl)** is looking for input on what topics they should address on a national level.
Send them an email (info@hetpnn.nl) or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/hetpnn/status/1330469843720675333?s=03) with your thoughts. 
The PNN are also looking for input on how Dutch PhDs with a migration background experience their PhD so that they can provide recommendations to universities on how to improve the process. 
If you would like to share your story you can contact Rosanne Annholt, the chair of PNN (voorzitter@hetpnn.nl). 

And with that I will leave you alone for the rest of 2020 (unless you have any questions or requests)! 
I hope you are able to take some days off over the holidays to connect with friends and family (whether on or offline) and disconnect from work. It will still be there next year after all :) **Happy Holidays**!

Happy weekend!

P.S. if you want to receive Christmas presents, don’t forget to [document your code](https://twitter.com/ismonkeyuser/status/1332216804614303745) (and data)!
