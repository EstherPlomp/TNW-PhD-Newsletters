The workshop introduces deep learning to researchers who are familiar with the basics of (non-deep) machine learning and basics of Python programming. 
[Register here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introduction-to-deep-learning-tickets-235346907937).
-	The next [Data Carpentry](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/data-carpentry-workshop) (**spreadsheets/OpenRefine and introduction to R**) will take place between **February 21-25**.

# Writing
As we probably all set some writing goals for the new year, this newsletter is heavy on resources that I found helpful in writing scientific articles:

-	Follow this Coursera course on ‘[Writing in the Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite)’ to improve your writing skills. 
Particularly week 1-4 contain important information on how to structure your article and improve your writing.
-	Writing your **first article**? 
This [two-page article](https://www.mjdrdypv.org/text.asp?2021/14/6/599/329688) contains a good set up for your introduction and questions that you should address in your discussion (it is a bit medical focused but mostly generally applicable). 
[This blogpost shows you how to structure](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/the-5-pivotal-paragraphs-in-a-paper/) your article.
-	How to [write an **abstract** focusing on five sentences](https://twitter.com/kepadil1/status/1479226348120023043).
-	Answer these [questions in your **introduction**](https://twitter.com/scigradcoach/status/1445426054147964932). 
-	The [five ingredients for a successful **methods** section](https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2010.146589).
-	TU Delft offers access to the ‘[academic writing assistant](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/academic-writing-assistant)’ tool that can help you to improve the structure, style and spelling of your text.
-	‘[How to navigate **authorship** of scientific manuscripts](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-navigate-authorship-scientific-manuscripts)’ (you can use the [CRediT roles](https://casrai.org/credit/) to track contributions to the work, and use [Tenzing](https://rollercoaster.shinyapps.io/tenzing/) to easily record these roles).
You may also want to read: ‘[Why scientific journal authorship practices make no sense et al.](https://www.science.org/content/article/why-scientific-journal-authorship-makes-absolutely-no-sense-et-al)’ 
-	If you’re looking for a **free open access journal**, check out [SciPost](https://scipost.org/).  
-	Or you can procrastinate by reading more [writing tips on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rodriguesjm6/status/1436355550388932614) or watch this RIOT talk on ‘[Reimagining scientific publishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AX2vNMsX98)’!
-	Afterwards, you probably want to learn more about how you can [deal with **writing guilt**](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/961107677232418816).
