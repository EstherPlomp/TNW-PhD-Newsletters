The [ICT department currently has a survey open](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIezS9A2bMVTdCofhS3boLrVlUNVVHWTNCWEUxODlINjMxTjFFUlc4WFdLSCQlQCN0PWcu) to **improve the ICT services**. 
Please fill this out as the feedback of a sole Data Steward are not going to make a difference unfortunately! 
The survey will close on the **15th of May**.

There's a one hour workshop on [**'Introduction to Qualitative Methods** for Quantitative Researchers'](https://bethduckles.com/registration/intro-to-qualitative-methods) on the **19th of May** at 21:00 CEST.

The **Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology Conference 2021** (SBB 2021) is hosted on the **29-31 May**. You can [register for free on the website](https://sbb.akademisi.co.id/registration.php). 

In April the new [**TU Delft Software Policy and guidelines**](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies) were officially published! Please see the announcement for more information. The Library is organising two information sessions about:  

  * **Why a research software policy?** 
  (The new workflow is an improvement as you don't have to ask the Valorisation Center permission to publish your software through a disclosure form, as long as you follow the workflow)
  * **How to follow the workflow?** 
  (a super concise summary is to share your code/software through [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) choosing one of the TU Delft approved licenses (Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, AGPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0). 
  You can also choose another data repository, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), but then you have to ensure that the output is correctly registered in PURE yourself.) 
  * **Where to get help?** (email me!)
