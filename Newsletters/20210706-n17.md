The deadline for the applications for the [Open Life Science programme](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/group/guest/-/open-life-science-programme) is coming up on the **15th of July**! 
Although the title says Life Sciences, it is open to a wide range of disciplines. 
By participating in this 16 week course you will learn all about **Open Science principles and practices** and to top that: receive 5 GS discipline specific credits! 
If you have any doubts whether you would like to participate, please get in touch with myself or Emmy Tsang (F.Tsang@tudelft.nl)!  

Please nominate yourself or someone you know for the Convergence Health and Technology Open Research Award! 
You will receive a certificate of excellence and 100 euros if you win the **Open Research Award**. 
Anyone from TU Delft (master student, PhD, postdoc or research assistant) adopting open research practices in their work can be nominated.
