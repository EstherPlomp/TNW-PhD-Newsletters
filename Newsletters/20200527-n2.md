Good afternoon!

I would like to notify you again of some online events and calls related to data management:

Applications for the second round of the **[Open Life Science mentoring and training programme](https://openlifesci.org)** are open until the 30th of June. 
If you have a project that is related to Open Science and need a push to get it running, I can highly recommend this supportive community. 

On the 2nd to 4th of June the [**Code Refinery** will live stream a **software workshop**](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-05-25-online/#streaming-info) (intermediate/advanced level)! 
The videos from this week are already available on their [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery/videos). 
This workshop would have been organised in person at TU Delft in April, but had to be moved (for obvious reasons) to the last week of September. 
More details will follow as soon as I have them!  

On the 11th of June there are two online events: 
1)	The **[King’s Open Research Conference](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/kings-open-research-conference)** 
2)	A **workshop on Binder**, which allows you to share your software from GitHub in a single clickable link! 
[Sign up before the 31st of May on their Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/workshop-boost-research-reproducibility-with-binder-registration-105228216428).

Are you struggling with your PhD and would you like to discuss this with others? 
The **[PhD Balance Community](https://www.phdbalance.com/)** hosts calls every Saturday and provides a space to learn from others and their experiences. 

A gentle reminder about the **[Open Science Coffee moment](https://openscience-utrecht.com/oscoffee/)** on the Friday afternoon (15:00-16:00) organised by Utrecht University. 
This week we’re discussing [**Registered Reports**](https://www.cos.io/rr) with some Star Wars references! 

A working group from TU Delft previously set up a pilot to provide you with free licenses for two Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs): **[RSpace](https://www.researchspace.com/)** and **[eLABjournal](https://www.elabjournal.com/)**. 
If there is enough interest, the next software that we could pilot would be [BioRender](https://biorender.com/)! 
**BioRender** is used to create scientific illustrations. Please see [this Nature Technological Feature](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-01404-7) for more information. 
If you are interested in trying out BioRender (or RSpace/eLABjournal), please send me an email!

If you fell asleep from all the information in this email because you’re already aware of everything, please consider to become a [**Data Champion**](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/support/data-champions/) and share the code/data management love!

Please let me know if you need more information about any of these events or about other data management related issues! 
You can reach me through Skype for Business (also messaging) or e-mail.
