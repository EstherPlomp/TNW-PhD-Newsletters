# Research Data Management 101 for Applied Sciences? 
The [Research Data Management 101 course](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/research-data-management-101) is currently already fully enrolled for the rest of the academic year. 
I’m therefore checking if there is interest in a faculty version of this course. 
This course is particularly relevant for **first year PhDs** and includes setting up a Data Management Plan (one of the requirements you’ll have to complete for your Go-No/Go!). 
The idea is to hold this iteration in October/November, and perhaps another one at the start of 2023 (since you might not have data to work with if you started your PhD this month).

Main differences between the central and faculty version of the course: 
-	The faculty version will have two in-person sessions rather than three online sessions
-	For the self-paced parts we will not use Brightspace, but a website/GitHub
-	The main materials, assignments and credits you can receive are the same (1.5 credits for Research Skills)

Please fill out the form to **indicate your interest** in a faculty version of this course before **16 September**: 
Note that I’m using this form to check whether there’s interest: **This is not a registration yet!** 
(So please don’t deregister from the central course if you’re registered). 
You’ll be contacted whether the course will indeed take place after 16 September.

The US recently released an announcement that US funded research should be immediately accessible to the public, similar to policies that Dutch institutes and NWO already implemented.
