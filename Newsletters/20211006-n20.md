# Career
* Not sure what to do after your PhD? This [interview with Jennifer Polk](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WXJDQBNiiy42D9IBBHyyd?si=WRXeouhCQy-qk6F7qjb9ZA&dl_branch=1) contains some helpful pointers. 
* [Hsu et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj2604) contains short interviews with people in academic hiring committees (pages 9-11) that provides some insights in the hiring process (publications/funding may be less important if you have a clear vision on your work and are able to communicate your research well!). While the data is based on neuroscientists, some of the things are more generally applicable (such as institutions showing a preference for hiring individuals that they know).
* If you’re on the fence about staying or leaving academia, [this Twitter thread by Shoshana Jarvis](https://twitter.com/Shoshana_Jarvis/status/1428403324483629060) is for you.
