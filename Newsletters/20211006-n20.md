There is 1 spot remaining and you can [join the waiting list](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-carpentry-for-social-sciences-online-25-26-28-29-october-tickets-178855841637). 
(If the other spots are still open they may be able to accommodate more from Delft!) 
For the other programming workshops and courses offered by TU Delft, please see CoachView (https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us). 
* The Turing Institute is organising a free course on [Responsible Research and Innovation](https://www.eventsforce.net/turingevents/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=43818&eventID=134), particularly applicable to **data science or AI projects**. 
The course takes place online in several sessions between **8-12 November**. 
Application deadline is **20 October**. 
* BiosBB is running a **programming course** on [integrated modelling and optimization](https://www.biosb.nl/archive-courses/imocourse-2021/) for **bioinformatics (using Matlab), 3-17 December 2021,** Wageningen. 
Registration costs are 400 euros. 
Keep an eye out for other courses that they run!

# Funding & Opportunities
* The [eScience Center has a call out](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/calls-for-proposals/open-call-for-small-scale-initiatives-in-software-performance-optimization/) to support you with making your software run faster! 
Submit a proposal by **29 October**.
* You can apply for the [FAIR data fund](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/about-your-data/fair-data-fund) (up to €3.500) to **make your data more FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable!  
Deadline is **1st November**. 
* [Maranke Wieringa](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MAWieringa) is setting up a new Dutch interuniversity **network for people with a disability**: contact them for more information through their email (m.a.wieringa@uu.nl) or on [Twitter](ttps://twitter.com/MarankeWieringa/status/1444206272979554308?). 
* It is October! 
Which means that it is time for **Hacktoberfest**, a month in which you are encouraged to contribute to open source projects and earn a T-shirt! 
Please see the [Hacktober website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for more information. 

# Software
*	In September ‘**[SeptembRSE](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/)**’ took place. 
This was the Fifth Conference of Research Software Engineers. 
Recordings of the sessions are [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL27mQJy8eDHkB1Q9pu8pXpMa1AZtwov6Q). 
See for example the workshop on [software design and sustainability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_xSsl8iC4g&list=PL27mQJy8eDHkB1Q9pu8pXpMa1AZtwov6Q&index=10) (starts at 8 min, with the more practical part at 1.20-2.14 and the coding/interactive part at the end), the discussion session on [software testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9084fOirQYo&list=PL27mQJy8eDHkB1Q9pu8pXpMa1AZtwov6Q&index=21), the panel on ‘[missing narratives in discussions around diversity and inclusion in research software](https://youtu.be/tpxCWCTSZUc?t=2014)’, and a session on the [different aspects of the RSE roles](https://youtu.be/beGmYKVNApA).
*	Hesitant about **sharing your software/code?** 
This [Twitter thread by Colin Angus](https://twitter.com/VictimOfMaths/status/1405809689246507010) highlights the benefits.
*	Doubting whether your **software is ready to be published** in the Journal of Open Source Software? 
[Read a blogpost about to know for sure](http://pdebuyl.be/blog/2021/joss-ready.html). 
* **Python**: 
  * [This presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSSgLflyisI&list=PLiX54geLkpPL4brRcYfnekp42PLJi5eEe) by Serena Bonaretti contains some nice resources (on slide 25, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3939392) to learn how to use Python/Jupyter notebooks. 
  *	[Nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) seems handy for Jupyter notebooks (headers, notifications when cells are done running, code folding). 
  *	[Pylustrator](https://pylustrator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offers an interactive interface to find the best way to present your data in a figure for publication. Added formatting an styling can be saved by automatically generated code.
  *	Learn more about testing your Python code by listening to a [podcast on research software testing](https://podcastaddict.com/episode/116745171).
  * [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) tracebacks will annotate where exactly the error is happening in your code!
