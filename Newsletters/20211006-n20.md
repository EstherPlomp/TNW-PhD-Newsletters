(If the other spots are still open they may be able to accommodate more from Delft!) 
For the other programming workshops and courses offered by TU Delft, please see CoachView (https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us). 
* The Turing Institute is organising a free course on [Responsible Research and Innovation](https://www.eventsforce.net/turingevents/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=43818&eventID=134), particularly applicable to **data science or AI projects**. 
The course takes place online in several sessions between **8-12 November**. 
Application deadline is **20 October**. 
* BiosBB is running a **programming course** on [integrated modelling and optimization](https://www.biosb.nl/archive-courses/imocourse-2021/) for **bioinformatics (using Matlab), 3-17 December 2021,** Wageningen. 
Registration costs are 400 euros. 
Keep an eye out for other courses that they run!

# Funding & Opportunities
* The [eScience Center has a call out](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/calls-for-proposals/open-call-for-small-scale-initiatives-in-software-performance-optimization/) to support you with making your software run faster! 
Submit a proposal by **29 October**.
* You can apply for the [FAIR data fund](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/about-your-data/fair-data-fund) (up to €3.500) to **make your data more FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable!  
Deadline is **1st November**. 
* [Maranke Wieringa](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MAWieringa) is setting up a new Dutch interuniversity **network for people with a disability**: contact them for more information through their email (m.a.wieringa@uu.nl) or on [Twitter](ttps://twitter.com/MarankeWieringa/status/1444206272979554308?). 
* It is October! 
Which means that it is time for **Hacktoberfest**, a month in which you are encouraged to contribute to open source projects and earn a T-shirt! 
Please see the [Hacktober website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for more information. 

# Software
*	In September ‘**[SeptembRSE](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/)**’ took place. 
This was the Fifth Conference of Research Software Engineers. 
Recordings of the sessions are [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL27mQJy8eDHkB1Q9pu8pXpMa1AZtwov6Q). 
See for example the workshop on [software design and sustainability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_xSsl8iC4g&list=PL27mQJy8eDHkB1Q9pu8pXpMa1AZtwov6Q&index=10) (starts at 8 min, with the more practical part at 1.20-2.14 and the coding/interactive part at the end), the discussion session on [software testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9084fOirQYo&list=PL27mQJy8eDHkB1Q9pu8pXpMa1AZtwov6Q&index=21), the panel on ‘[missing narratives in discussions around diversity and inclusion in research software](https://youtu.be/tpxCWCTSZUc?t=2014)’, and ..
*	Hesitant about **sharing your software/code?** 
This [Twitter thread by Colin Angus](https://twitter.com/VictimOfMaths/status/1405809689246507010) highlights the benefits.
*	Doubting whether your **software is ready to be published** in the Journal of Open Source Software? 
[Read a blogpost about to know for sure]. 
* **Python**: 
  * [This presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSSgLflyisI&list=PLiX54geLkpPL4brRcYfnekp42PLJi5eEe) by Serena Bonaretti contains some nice resources (on slide 25, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3939392) to learn how to use Python/Jupyter notebooks. 
  *	[Nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) seems handy for Jupyter notebooks (headers, notifications when cells are done running, code folding). 
  *	[Pylustrator](https://pylustrator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offers an interactive interface to find the best way to present your data in a figure for publication. Added formatting an styling can be saved by automatically generated code.
  *	Learn more about testing your Python code by listening to a [podcast on research software testing](https://podcastaddict.com/episode/116745171).
  * [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) tracebacks will annotate where exactly the error is happening in your code! 


# Career
* Not sure what to do after your PhD? This [interview with Jennifer Polk](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WXJDQBNiiy42D9IBBHyyd?si=WRXeouhCQy-qk6F7qjb9ZA&dl_branch=1) contains some helpful pointers. 
* [Hsu et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj2604) contains short interviews with people in academic hiring committees (pages 9-11) that provides some insights in the hiring process (publications/funding may be less important if you have a clear vision on your work and are able to communicate your research well!). While the data is based on neuroscientists, some of the things are more generally applicable (such as institutions showing a preference for hiring individuals that they know).
* If you’re on the fence about staying or leaving academia, [this Twitter thread by Shoshana Jarvis](https://twitter.com/Shoshana_Jarvis/status/1428403324483629060) is for you. 

And on a less serious note: [What if the Marvel films were linux commands?](https://twitter.com/cooperrc84/status/1445489035376353292) 
And how do [Lord of the Rings GIFs describe the academic experience](https://twitter.com/AndrewBarnas/status/1440361521377280002?s=03)?
