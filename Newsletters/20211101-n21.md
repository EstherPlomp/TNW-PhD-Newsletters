## Events
*	The **SSI Research Software Camp**: Beyond the Spreadsheet runs from **1-12 November**.
*	On **18 November** the launch of the **ReproHack** Hub takes place. A ReproHack is a one day hackathon that focuses on reproducing papers. 
Submit your paper or participate in the event to get some practical experience in reproducibility! 
*	SURF is organising a **[Research Bootcamp week](https://www.surf.nl/agenda/surf-research-bootcamp-0) (15-18 November)** with sessions on (amongst others) data management, online collaboration environments, and high performance computing. 
*	The **Open Publishing** fest takes place online from **11-20 November**. 
The [programme](https://openpublishingfest.org/calendar.html) contains many demos, chats and workshops and is open to hosting your own event!
*	The fourth **[Applied Bioinformatics in Life Sciences](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/applied-bioinformatics-in-life-sciences-4th-edition)** takes place on **10-11 March** in Leuven.

## Programming workshops: 
*	The eScience center is organizing a course on **Parallel Programming in Python** from **10-12 November**. [Register TODAY](https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/2021-11-10-ds-parallel/).
*	The [UvA **Genomics Data Carpentry](https://uba.uva.nl/en/content/events/courses/2021/11/data-skills-for-genomics.html) on 30 November and 1 December** is open for TU Delft registrations and is still looking for helpers! 
As the course materials are very similar to the courses TU Delft has provided it would be possible to get 2 Research Skills GS credits for attending (credits for helping is unsure). Please reach out if you’re interested in attending for credits or helping out during the workshop. 
*	You can also help out in the next TU Delft **basic programming workshop**, Software Carpentry Workshop, on **15-19 November** for GS credits “learning on the job” (contact Paula - P.M.MartinezLavanchy@tudelft.nl for more info).

## Opportunities: 
*	You can apply for support from our **Digital Competence Centre (DCC)** that involves up to 340 hours of hands-on help from research software engineers and data managers until the 19th of November. 
On the DCC website you can find the [application form and criteria for acceptance](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/setting-up-research/dcc/apply-for-support). 
*	The Software Sustainability Institute is hiring a **Research Associate**: application deadline is **17 November**. 
*	[eLife is looking for ambassadors](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/bd8565f0/elife-ambassadors-an-invitation-to-take-part-in-2022?) that would like to **promote equitable, open, transparent research**. Apply by **7 November**! 
*	RStudio is running a **Table Contest**: [submit your entry](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/09/30/rstudio-table-contest-2021/) by **15 November**.

## Career
*	**Not sure** what to do after your PhD? This [interview with Jennifer Polk](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5WXJDQBNiiy42D9IBBHyyd?si=WRXeouhCQy-qk6F7qjb9ZA&dl_branch=1) contains some helpful pointers. 
If you’re on the fence about staying or leaving academia, this [Twitter thread by Shoshana Jarvis](https://twitter.com/Shoshana_Jarvis/status/1428403324483629060) is for you. 
*	If you want to apply for a **position in another lab**, [these are a couple of good questions](https://twitter.com/ProfessorTanvir/status/1448690023277203459) to ask to see if the lab will be a good fit for you! 
*	If you’re **leaving academia** it is a good idea to work on your [career transition story](https://beyondprof.com/your-phd-career-transition-story/).
*	[Hsu et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj2604) contains short **interviews** with people in academic hiring committees (pages 9-11) that provides some insights in the hiring process (publications/funding may be less important if you have a clear vision on your work and are able to communicate your research well!). While the data is based on neuroscientists, some of the things are more generally applicable (such as institutions showing a preference for hiring individuals that they know).

In case people are telling you to show more grit or just buckle up or work harder during your PhD, you might want to watch this video “[Grittier Than You](https://www.ted.com/talks/cait_kirby_grittier_than_you)”. 
For some more tips on how to get through your PhD you can read my blog “[PhD in 4 - 5, 6, 7](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/phd-in-4-5-6-7)”.
