Good afternoon!

As TU Delft/TNW is moving from a focus on data to a more general open science perspective, I renamed this update ‘Open Science events/info’ (from ‘data management events/info’)! 
The content will be similar.

**R users**: In case you missed the useR! 2020, the presentations are available on the [useR! YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_R5smHVXRYGhZYDJsnXTwg). 
I particularly recommend the one on [how to make your paper/code more reproducible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHMW8fV2NXo) by Anna Krystalli. 
You can also have a look at the [slides](https://annakrystalli.me/talks/user2020.html#1) and [materials](https://annakrystalli.me/rrresearchACCE20/) from the talk. 
You can use the *here package* to make it easier for others to work with your code (see [this video](https://youtu.be/QYrdsjBvZN4)). 
You can also use GitHub to work collaboratively with others using version control, and use the *renv* and *drake packages* (see [this video](https://youtu.be/xrALIrUEshc)). 
They are also still organizing some [tutorials that you can sign up for](https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/)!

**Python users**: You can also watch the [recordings from SciPy 2020](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkhm72fuzkS9fYGlGpEmj7A). 
I particularly recommend the [talk on Frictionless Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAi4OnfH-Q) that introduces some tools to document your data more systematically and check your tabular data. 
The [European Python Conference](https://www.youtube.com/user/PythonItalia) took place in July, and had some presentations on using Python to manage your projects: [‘Python table manners’](https://speakerdeck.com/leew/python-table-manners-cut-the-cookie-gracefully-at-euro-python-2020) and [‘Scientific Python Cookiecutter’](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/preliminaries.html). 
Also, [JupyterCon 2020](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytercon-online-more-than-a-conference-4677cf25a915) Online takes place during October 5-17.

TU Delft is organising some **basic software programming workshops** (online). 
The next one, covering among others Git and Python, will take place in the beginning of October (dates are not confirmed yet). 
The next **Genomics data carpentry** takes place in September (16-17, 23-24). Please let me know if you would like more information or if you would like to be placed on the waiting list.

[TIGER in STEMM](https://www.tigerinstemm.org/) is holding a summer webinar series on physics research topics over the summer on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEBGiUuUXJNuicJsHYlOyg), every Thursday from 5-6 pm. 

If you missed the **King’s Open Research Conference** (11th June) there is a [blogpost summary available which includes the recordings](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/daring-to-shift-research-culture-towards-more-reproducibility-and-transparency).  

Did you share your data and code but you have no idea how to put this on your **CV**? 
Check [this example](https://bartlettje.github.io/BartlettJE.github.io/research/).
Make sure that you set up an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) so that you can always link to your ORCID in your CV! 

The materials from the “Strategies to overcome your challenges in **multi-omics data integration**’ are now online on their [website](https://x-omics.nl/x-omics-online-workshop-series-strategies-to-overcome-your-challenges-in-multi-omics-data-integration). 

Want to check your article before submission for mistakes? The [PubReCheck tool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/PubReCheck/#/) can identify some issues with your text. 

As always, if you have any questions about any of these events or about other open science/data/software related stuff: Please feel free to get in touch!

Have a good summer!
