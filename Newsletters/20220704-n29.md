# Opportunities 
NASA is looking for **stories of practicing Open Science**! Stories can include but are not limited to: working with open-source tools/software resulting in more collaborative and reproducible science, and conducting research more collaboratively and transparently. Want to share your story through a virtual interview? [Please sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdldizA6KQWNp3A_eVB383x4IYjXEPGlfPHXCJSqYqjb6UhBA/viewform).

**No experience with Open Science practises yet**? This [Open Science Buffet](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6752865) poster will point you to some resources that we have at TU Delft that can support you!
