# Opportunities 
NASA is looking for **stories of practicing Open Science**! Stories can include but are not limited to: (1) working with open-source tools/software resulting in more collaborative and reproducible science, (2) conducting research more collaboratively and transparently, and (3) empowering greater participation in the scientific process and accelerating career opportunities. If you are interested in sharing your story through a virtual interview, [please sign up]( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdldizA6KQWNp3A_eVB383x4IYjXEPGlfPHXCJSqYqjb6UhBA/viewform).

**No experience with Open Science practises yet**? This [Open Science Buffet](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6752865) poster will point you to some resources that we have at TU Delft that can support you!
