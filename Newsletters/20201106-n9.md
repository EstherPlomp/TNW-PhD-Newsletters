Good afternoon!

Please find below some info on research data/code management and open science related events and information:

Want to start **making your research more open** but you’re not sure where to start? 
This video presentation on [‘Easing into Open Science’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owJaD3UiseQ) provides you with some good starting points! 
See also the [Open Scholarship Knowledge Base](https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/OSKB) which contains a lot of resources that can help you to make your research more open. 

Not sure where to **publish your next article**? 
[Think, Check, Submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) has checklists for [books](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/books-and-chapters/) and [journals](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) to avoid you from publishing with predatory publishers.
Want to learn more about the publishing process? 
Watch this [short video on academic publishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PriwCi6SzLo&feature=youtu.be).

If you want to learn about **preregistrations and registered reports**, and what the difference is between them, I can recommend watching [this video introduction to Preregistration](https://ox.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=db83bd17-4c08-466b-9ced-ac60012e7573).

The National Survey on **Research Integrity** has launched (see the [recordings of the launching symposium](http://www.nsri2020.nl/symposium)). 
This is a tool to understand research practices across disciplines, in order to improve our practices and trust in science. 
If you received an email from Kantar to join this survey, please fill it in! 

Some points that you may want to discuss with your supervisor can be found in this [Mentoring and Advising agreement document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oOPjjF8RJ1EOFvZMFAKe19hUVyQ5FRpS-tPV_uE1dcI/edit). 
It can be good to manage expectations early from both sides.

Some short tips on learning about **coding and code sharing**: 
*	If sets, arrays and queues are not making any sense to you, you can watch this [short video on **data structures**](https://www.tiktok.com/@theannalytical/video/6876070561194282245?_d=secCgsIARCbDRgBIAIoARI%2BCjzQW45DNjGBfp3q5jKnY0Wjujb6t%2BqEM354CC8w4ErFCQntXwKRpQD16uhoZjWLeaES4%2BH%2BbiqmSRgv1ooaAA%3D%3D&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAARTPuNiMjZQd4RUeJY813qXqlzIUxij_ISySZXOKEe_L5kZyEQ2h5nU8xD5AUZ7c2&share_item_id=6876070561194282245&share_link_id=404A63E3-E6FF-4114-BEAC-746B33C7E061&timestamp=1600960056&tt_from=copy&u_code=d78eg579kl69fh&user_id=6714106760716813317&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m) for a memorable explanation. 
*	Are you taking full advantage of **Python 3**? Here are [10 Python 3 features](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1308632185113579522?s=03) that will change the way you are writing code today. 
*	This short [podcast on using **Git/GitHub** (and R)](https://intertidal.agency/intertidal-podcast/2020/9/14/9-using-git-to-drive-better-science-with-dr-julie-lowndes) is helpful to get started and contains some nice resources on the webpage. 
*	Want to get started with version control? Read this blog on **version control**: [Git or Perish](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sm/2020/08/25/git-or-perish/). 
*	Want to **share your code** but not sure how to start? This vlog will provide you with some tips on [how to start with code sharing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7h0A-KvWls&). 
You can also watch this longer seminar on [sharing brain MRI data/code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28XzdqbGKoE&feature=youtu.be), the information is very clear and generally applicable!  
*	Do you need to **clean up your code and improve your documentation**? 
Learn more about [Best practices for writing reproducible code](https://bvreede.github.io/presentations/presentations/2020-09-17_BestPractices-lecture.html#1) (slides by Barbara Vreede).
*	If you use **R** and want to integrate it with a GitHub repository and easily spit out paper/preregistration templates, I can highly recommend watching this [15 minute video on the R Package WORCS, Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzjpN_yFeUU). 

And if you want to listen to some **podcasts**: 
*	How to dismantle [systemic racism in science](https://cen.acs.org/careers/diversity/Podcast-Black-chemists-discuss-strategies/98/web/2020/09)
*	How to [self-correct science](http://www.juiceandsqueeze.net/17)

And if one of your students is still looking for a job, there are two vacancies for [event coordination](https://www.stud.nl/students/work/event-coordinator/) and [web editing](https://www.stud.nl/students/work/web-content-editor/) at the TU Delft Library. 

As always, if you have any questions about any of this information or about other open science/data/software related stuff: Please feel free to get in touch!

Have a good weekend!
