To receive more information about Open Science at TU Delft you can also [sign up for the Open Science Community](https://osc-delft.github.io/join) and receive the newsletter, or read up first on [why joining such a community would be beneficial to you](https://ecrlife.org/ecrs-and-scientific-communities/). 
* [TU Delft Library is organising an event](https://www.aanmelder.nl/158259/home) on **Changing Publication Culture** on **8 October** (14:30-17:00).

# Open Publishing
No time to join the event on Changing Publishing Culture? Here are a couple of reads on the **Academic publication culture**: 
- [More is not better: the developing crisis of scientific publishing](https://council.science/blog/more-is-not-better-the-developing-crisis-of-scientific-publishing/).
- Should you **preprint** your work? [Read a case study about this](https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/faustfiles/110936), or some general motivations about [Why you should preprint your next paper](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/85d36b45/open-science-why-you-should-preprint-your-next-paper).
- Once you do preprint your work, [Collaborative **Peer Review** Can Transform Scientific Research](https://content.prereview.org/how-collaborative-peer-review-can-transform-scientific-research/).
Open Science also [increases the transparency of the review process, especially if combined with open peer review](https://www.ucpress.edu/blog-posts/60337-peer-review-week-2022-an-interview-with-collabra-psychologys-eiko-fried). 
- [Sharing is Caring: But How to Distribute **Open Hardware**?](https://blog.addgene.org/sharing-is-caring-but-how-to-distribute-open-hardware)
- **Negative results** also [deserve to be published](https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/24-06-2024-even-negative-research-findings-deserve-to-be-published-others-can-learn-from-them)! 
- Read how a PhD candidate [learned how to embrace **Open Science**](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-i-learned-embrace-open-science).
- Transparancy in research also means **transparency about positionality**: Learn more about this from a [Lightening Talk on Positionality Statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FS4ve0M1Ls). 

# Switch in Data Steward
You may have noticed in the previous newsletters that I shared a vacancy for a Data Steward at this Faculty. 
This, unfortunately, does not mean that the capacity at the faculty gets extended (especially not now with **budget cuts** coming up – [read up on what you can do about this](https://crookedtimber.org/2024/09/06/action-list-to-protect-universities-from-budget-cuts/)!). 
I will move to Aruba in December and will leave the TU Delft, so a new person will take over. 
This means that **there may be a gap in support in the upcoming period**: if you have anything research data management related that you want to tackle this year, please do so **before 15 November**. 
After this date there will still be support, but it will likely be slower or taking place online.

If you **just started your PhD** and if you’re not sure whether you should reach out, [this post about what is expected you in terms of data management](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/DMP-PhD/) may help! 
See you in the upcoming onboarding meeting on 25 September!

# Code & Data Office hours
Do you need **help with writing code and managing data more effectively**? 
[Sign up for a session of 45 minutes](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/support/library-for-researchers/setting-up-research/dcc/code-data-office-hours) to receive support from a Data Manager or Research Software Engineer from the Digital Competence Center (TU Delft ICT/Library)!
