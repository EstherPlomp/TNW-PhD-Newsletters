# Software
-	Are you an **R user**? 
    -	Join an online workshop on [Reproducibility data analysis with R](https://physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/r-reproducibility/) in the mornings of **28-31 October**. 
    -	Don’t forget about the [R Cafés](https://delft-rcafe.github.io/home/) that are organised at TU Delft!
    -	Read a blogpost on [Beautiful Code, Because We’re Worth It]( https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/02/22/beautiful-code/)!

    -	Videos from the 2023 version of [Python for Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/python-for-scicomp-2023/) are online! 
See for example the [materials](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/ ) or specific videos on [visualisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGdBLwNkB1Q&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nNI3oQEqSJW6yXltOAZnkpa&index=9), [data formats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT2m5wYOsWY&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nNI3oQEqSJW6yXltOAZnkpa&index=9&pp=iAQB), [productivity tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSqSz3B9u5Q&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nNI3oQEqSJW6yXltOAZnkpa&index=11), [dependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MrZMSPUFG8&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nNI3oQEqSJW6yXltOAZnkpa&index=14&pp=iAQB), [parallel computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnaxsAFPhk0&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nNI3oQEqSJW6yXltOAZnkpa&index=18), and [packaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFo7pChFtVs&list=PLZLVmS9rf3nNI3oQEqSJW6yXltOAZnkpa&index=19).
    -	Read up on why you should [make your Python code more modular](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/dynamic-types-static-types-oh-my-py-25c9743b72c4).
-	Start with writing **clean code** by reading up on some blogs:
    -	[Writing code for your future self](https://dev.to/sunnysingh/writing-code-for-your-future-self-3da2)
    -	[How to Set Your Future Self Up for Success with Good Coding Habits](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/set-future-you-up-for-success-with-good-coding-habits/)
    -	[Coding and Comment Style]( https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/coding-and-comment-style/)
    -	Or check out a full course on [Best Practices for Writing Reproducible Code](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/) by Utrecht University!
-	The Research Data Management 101 course had some additions for **[software sharing]( https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-RDM-101/10-Realising-FAIR-Publication.html#software-sharing)**.
-	Distribits 2024 recordings are up, for example the talk by [Julia Thönnißen: Balancing Efficiency and Standardization for a Microscopic Image Repository on HPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYAZN9c4WvA&list=PLEQHbPfpVqU6esVrgqjfYybY394XD2qf2&index=7), using tools such as datalad and rsync
-	It is important to document the **dependencies and workflow for your software** to allow others to reproduce your results (or for you to use your software on a different computer :)). You can list dependencies in a text file, or use more advanced tools: 
    -	[Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) (Python) or renv (R): a package/environment management system. 
    -	[myBinder]( https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html): online service to make your repositories interactive and executable.
    -	[Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/): containerisation platform that allows you to package, distribute, and reproduce software and experiments in a consistent and portable way. 
        -	See [Setting a Dockerized Python Development Environment Template](https://medium.com/@rami.krispin/setting-a-dockerized-python-development-environment-template-de2400c4812b)
        -	See also some [slides on Docker for Reproducible Research](https://osf.io/zm9qn ) by Philipp Zumstein
    -	[Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/): workflow management system for creating and executing reproducible data analysis pipelines ([Mölder et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.29032.2)).
    -	See also [Secrets and environments](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/research-software-security-snippets-2) to **prevent accidental sharing of information**!
-	Check out [this intermediate level crash course]( https://embl-ebi.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bd24ae15-26a1-40d0-a511-adc001029e3e) on **management of software projects** (for software that is beyond just an analysis script and is more a tool on itself!) 
-	Check if your repositories are included in Hugging Face’s [The Stack](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/in-the-stack).
-	**Bugs**: Check out [how to avoid them](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/three-ways-researchers-science-can-avoid-common-programming-bugs-errors) and [how to fix them](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/). 

In case you missed it in the TNW Today: there is now an overview of commonly used [Open Access Journals by Applied Sciences]( https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-access-journals-applied-sciences). Let me know if your favourite **Open Access journal** is missing, so we can add it to the list!
