# Open Access
-	Learn more about the recent Neuro Image editorial resignations from a [video by Dr. Glaucomflecken]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoUGiS1LeKU) or read up on how '[How Scientific Publishers' Extreme Fees Put Profit Over Progress]( https://www.thenation.com/article/society/neuroimage-elsevier-editorial-board-journal-profit/)'. 
-	Note that **publishing Open Access does not have to be expensive** – for example: [SciPost](https://scipost.org/) and [Peer Community In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MKpImtupHI) allow you to do this without costs to you. TU Delft also has deals with several journals which you can check in the [journal browser](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/library-for-researchers/library-for-researchers/publishing-outreach/journal-browser).

-	Read up on the possibilities for [providing **access to reagents**](https://www.the-scientist.com/careers/what-if-scientists-shared-their-reagents-for-free-70170). 

Also, a [recent preprint]( https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s5b6j) is highlighting the **gender inequality** in ‘cum laude’ for PhD candidates at a Dutch University, where women were ‘almost two times less likely to get a ‘cum laude’ distinction’. 
If that pisses you off, do reach out to the Central Graduate School with your concerns and questions about TU Delft's data on this.
