# Events and opportunities

* The [Open Science programme previously co-organised by Applied Sciences](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme) now has a **shortened course on Open Science**: [OLS-NASA Open Science 101 Program](https://openlifesci.org/nasa)! This shortened version is 6 weeks long (**11 March – 19 April**) and covers the [Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/take-os101/) with hands-on learning and individual coaching. Are you – and your team members – interested in taking your first steps to open science and pilot this new programme? The pilot programme is free of charge – future iterations are expected to have a participation fee. Apply before **20 February**. (We have not yet set GS credits yet for participation – but I can see what can be done!)
* Sign up for an afternoon (**14 March, 12:30-17:00**) on **Python in Teaching** at TU Delft. The organisers invite you to shape the programme by contributing with an activity by filling out an [application form]( https://www.tudelft.nl/evenementen/2024/teaching-academy/python-in-teaching-14-march) by **22 February**. You can also participate without contributing to the programme via this application form!
* The dates for the next **Turing Way Book Dash** have changed to **3-7 June**. [Sign up for an onboarding call](https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcscO6vpjIrGdKaQ_LeSBYr4XVZpMYmEjho#/registration) on **27 March 16:00** to learn more about [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html), a book and community on reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science.
* [Save the date]( https://www.openscience.nl/en/news/save-the-date-national-open-science-festival-will-take-place-on-22-october-2024) for the **National Open Science Festival** on **22 October**.
* **Reminder**: Apply for the TU Delft [Mainstreaming **Open Science Fund**](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/open-science/articles-tu-delft/mainstreaming-open-science-fund-2024) (up to 10.000 Euros) until **15 February** to advance Open Science practices! Any Open Science Community Delft community member can apply ([join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2Cha-gy0J5mLzMvlTjT66XLn-c0TBo5FxYG0-JC9TE5aMBw/viewform) if you’re not a member yet!). 

# Programming events and opportunities

* **Reminder**: The **version control with Git** workshop will now be held **online** (instead of in Utrecht!) on **21-22 February**! 
[Register via Eventbrite](https://community.data.4tu.nl/2023/12/07/workshop-on-versioning-control-with-git/).
* The next **intermediate programming workshop**, CodeRefinery, takes place on **March 12-14 and 19-21**. 
The workshop covers good coding practices, reproducible research principles, and using Git for collaboration.
TU Delft does not organise an in person part of the workshop this year - [please sign up via the Coderefinery website](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/).
* Do you use **Julia**? Julia users are trying to setup a meeting in Amsterdam – [fill out the form](https://forms.gle/CDTVtBoC3iRD6dJt9) if you’re interested.  
* **Reminder**: The deadline for applications for the [eSciencecenter Fellowship Programme](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/) is **8 April 2024**. 
Individuals who want to improve the use of open and sustainable research software within their organisation or discipline are invited to apply or join the [information session](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/the-escience-center-fellowship-programme-information-session-tickets-765130936227) on **21 February (14:00)**, or email fellowship@esciencecenter.nl with questions.

# Open Science Support Website
Some of the [Open Science Support Website](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/) posts have been updated or added: 
*	Want to publish in a **Gold Open Access journal**? [This overview contains examples and costs for journals](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/Open-access-TNW/) that Applied Sciences researchers have published in before.
    * Checkout [B!SON](https://service.tib.eu/bison/): a tool that helps you to find a suitable Open Access journal for your publication!
*	The **storage solutions** overview now contains a [recommended storage strategy section](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/storage-solutions/#storage-strategy-during-the-project).
* There is a new [supervisor checklist for sharing PhD outputs](https://estherplomp.github.io/TNW-OS-support/posts/data-sharing-how-PhD-supervisor/) to share with your supervisor when you need to discuss **how to share your data/code before you can defend**!
* If you have any ideas for posts, or feedback on the existing content, please let Esther know!

# Reproduciblity
* Watch **webinars on reproducibility**, such as [Approaches to Scientific Error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQky95-lhY) with Dr. Amy Orben or [Why openness and reproducibility makes research software better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abij6ITfpUA) by Yo Yehudi.
* Read a blogpost on [Keeping science reproducible in a world of custom code and data](https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/keeping-science-reproducible-in-a-world-of-custom-code-and-data/)
*	**Physical samples** also play a role in reproducibility: [Organize your –80 °C freezer to save time and prevent frozen fingertips](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00031-w). 
* Check out community-developed checklists for **publishing images and image analyses** by [Schmied et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01987-9).
* Try out [Surge: a fast open-source chemical graph generator](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-022-00604-9)!
