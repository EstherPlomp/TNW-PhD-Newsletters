# Events and opportunities

* The [Open Science programme previously co-organised by Applied Sciences](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/open-life-science-programme) now has a **shortened course on Open Science**: [OLS-NASA Open Science 101 Program](https://openlifesci.org/nasa)! This shortened version is 6 weeks long (**11 March – 19 April**) and covers the Open Science 101 Curriculum with hands-on learning and individual coaching. Are you – and your team members – interested in taking your first steps to open science and pilot this new programme? The pilot programme is free of charge – future iterations are expected to have a participation fee. Apply before **20 February**. (We have not yet set GS credits yet for participation – but I can see what can be done!)
* [Save the date]( https://www.openscience.nl/en/news/save-the-date-national-open-science-festival-will-take-place-on-22-october-2024) for the **National Open Science Festival** on **22 October** 
* The dates for the next **Turing Way Book Dash** have changed to **3-7 June**. [Sign up for an onboarding call](https://turing-uk.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcscO6vpjIrGdKaQ_LeSBYr4XVZpMYmEjho#/registration) on **27 March 16:00** to learn more about [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html), a book and community on reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science.
* Sign up for an afternoon (**14 March, 12:30-17:00**) on **Python in Teaching** at TU Delft. The organisers invite you to shape the programme by contributing with an activity by filling out an [application form]( https://www.tudelft.nl/evenementen/2024/teaching-academy/python-in-teaching-14-march) by **22 February**. You can also participate without contributing to the programme via this application form!
* **Reminder**: Apply for the TU Delft Mainstreaming **Open Science Fund** (up to 10.000 Euros) until **15 February** to advance Open Science practices! Any Open Science Community Delft community member can apply ([join the community](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2Cha-gy0J5mLzMvlTjT66XLn-c0TBo5FxYG0-JC9TE5aMBw/viewform) if you’re not a member yet!).
