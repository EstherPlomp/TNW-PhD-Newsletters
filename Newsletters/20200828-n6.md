Dear all, 

For this newsletter I have one event that you could attend and loads of information related to data/code/open science!

You are very welcome to attend the launch of our **Open Science Community Delft** on the 17th of September from 15:00 to 17:30. 
Here you can learn about what TU Delft researchers are doing in terms of Open Science and bring your own ideas to the table in a more interactive session. 
You can [register for the online event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-science-community-delft-launch-september-17th-online-tickets-113622471872?aff=ebdssbeac). I’m looking forward to seeing you there!

If you haven’t **published an article** yet [this webinar](https://codata.org/initiatives/strategic-programme/codata-connect/webinar-series-research-skills/webinar-5-how-to-get-published-and-best-practice-for-open-research/) may be helpful. 
Matt Cannon from Taylor & Francis explains Open Access, Data Sharing, Registered Reports, Peer Review and gives some tips on how to get your article accepted. 
(Do note the irony in the definition of predatory publishing: if we base that on publishers making money any for-profit publisher could be considered predatory..) 
If you’re looking for a publisher that does not request fees for their openly accessible articles and has a robust peer review system, I suggest checking out [SciPost](https://scipost.org/). 
You may also find this [11 step guide](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/11-steps-to-structuring-a-science-paper-editors-will-take-seriously) helpful when you’re writing your article. 
If you are considering writing a **literature review**, [chapter 7 of this book](https://au.sagepub.com/en-gb/oce/completing-your-qualitative-dissertation/book259355#preview) may be useful. 

Found an article that is not openly accessible and behind a **paywall**? 
Using [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.tw/) for this is effective but actually illegal. 
Please consider using the [Unpaywall plugin](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension) for Firefox and Chrome to access these articles. 
The plugin shows a green button when there is an open access version of the article available and if you click the button you will be led directly to it! 
This could also be helpful to access articles that TU Delft does not have access to. 

Now is probably a good time to get your **paperwork or labjournal** sorted out digitally. 
Here is a [blogpost that contains some tips on how to organise your paperwork](https://alexwlchan.net/2019/11/my-scanning-setup/). 
If you’re interested in going electronic with your lab notebook, TU Delft offers licenses for [eLABjournal](https://www.elabjournal.com/) and [RSpace](https://www.researchspace.com/)! 
Please let me know if you’re interested in getting started with these electronic lab notebooks.

Want to learn more about **code/data management**? 
When you make your data/code available you should select a **license** that will tell re-users of your outputs how they can reuse the work. 
If you have no idea what license you should select there’s a [website with explanations on licenses in plain English](https://tldrlegal.com/). 
You can use the [Choose a License website](https://choosealicense.com/) to find a license that suits your data/code. 
(If you want the shortcut, TU Delft recommends the MIT license for code and CC-BY for data.) 
You can also listen to [this webinar on Open Software licenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9y8a3O4fjg), where they also discuss **readme files** (30.48 – 41:00), which you need for your project to describe it to others and tell them how to interact with your code/software. 
You can also learn about **contribution guidelines** and how to set up a **code of conduct** (46:00 – 1:01) from the same webinar. 
For data licenses and data management, you can watch [this presentation](https://youtu.be/hiLDGLfXa2s?t=3850) (1:04-1:17) from the same webinar series. 
If you would like to learn how to set up a repository and your own website on **GitHub** follow [this webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRUvQgKbVZQ). 

If you’re looking for more information on career/life balance, see this this [blogpost on careers in data science](https://www.sushmitagopalan.com/post/navigating-data-science-jobs/navigating-data-science-careers/) and listen to the [Papa PhD podcast](https://papaphd.com/). 
[PhD balance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI1kMS6Sm61xJAJCGqp6Pqw) still livestreams on Saturday evenings. 
This [blogpost has some tips on staying productive](https://smartsciencecareer.com/corona-career/) during these messy times. 
You can also listen to this [new feminist podcast: The Academist](http://theacademinist.buzzsprout.com/). 

As always, if you have any questions about any of this information or about other open science/data/software related stuff: Please feel free to get in touch!

Happy weekend!
