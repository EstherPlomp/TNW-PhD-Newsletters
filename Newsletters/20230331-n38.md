# Academic freedom
-	Susanne Täuber was fired this month for writing an article on her own experiences to write a **critique of the system**, showcasing how programmes that are intended to help women can actually get in their way. You can [read more about the case](https://ukrant.nl/magazine/susanne-tauber-has-been-fired-if-we-stay-silent-now-the-systems-wins/?lang=en) and how to support Susanne, [listen to a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qDHjkRw08bVzmSGmzLpel?si=11ce2e3963284319), or use #AmINext to find posts about this on social media.
-	If you would like to improve the working environment at Applied Sciences, you can still send a short cover letter to be a part of the [Faculty’s diversity board](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/on-this-day-and-beyond-let-s-all-fully-embrace-equity-join-the-dei-board) to our Dean: Paulien Herder.
