# Reproducibility
- Ensuring you work reproducibility can prevent retractions later on, particularly when there are [software problems](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.314.5807.1856)
- [Does condensed matter physics need to worry about a replication crisis?](https://virtualscienceforum.org/reproducibility_in_cmp/) 
- Slides on [Data Management and Reproducibility: A Tasting Buffet](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7725483) by Shern Tee.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a tool for reproducibility and portability. 
[Learn more about Docker and how can you start using it](https://do4ds.com/chapters/sec2/2-4-docker.html)
- You can watch several webinar presentations on reproducibility: 
  - [Data sharing and reproducibility]( https://vimeo.com/668640629) by Dr Laurence Hunt (you can use [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl) and/or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to share data publicly!) 
  - [Open and Reproducible Coding: Perspective of an MSK Imaging Researcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiBjBt3NR8M) by Serena Bonaretti

# Academic freedom
-	Susanne Täuber was fired this month for writing an article on her own experiences to write a **critique of the system**, showcasing how programmes that are intended to help women can actually get in their way. You can [read more about the case](https://ukrant.nl/magazine/susanne-tauber-has-been-fired-if-we-stay-silent-now-the-systems-wins/?lang=en) and how to support Susanne, [listen to a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qDHjkRw08bVzmSGmzLpel?si=11ce2e3963284319), or use #AmINext to find posts about this on social media.
-	If you would like to improve the working environment at Applied Sciences, you can still send a short cover letter to be a part of the [Faculty’s diversity board](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/on-this-day-and-beyond-let-s-all-fully-embrace-equity-join-the-dei-board) to our Dean: Paulien Herder.
