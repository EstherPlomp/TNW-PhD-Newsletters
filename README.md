- [Watch a webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo4_mShJfyM) on **data/software sharing guidance**.
- **Personal Data** 
    - Personal data is any data that can lead to the identification of a person. 
      If you work with surveys, interviews or videos of people – you’re working with personal data. 
      This requires extra care when managing the data. 
      See for example the [data privacy strategies outlined by The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpm/data-privacy-strategies.html).
    - TU Delft now has a self-paced **personal data course**. 
      You can sign up and follow it for 0.5 GS credits. 
      See the [website for more information](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/personal-data-human-subjects-in-research).
    - If you want to learn more about the laws that regulate processing of personal data, such as the **GDPR**, you can watch a talk on ‘[GDPR & processing of (identifiable) image, audio, and video data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2mv6q4WwOU)’ or ‘[Putting Data Protection into practice](https://youtu.be/eAKhI0qde2w?t=1110)’ (18:30-38:50). 
Or if you’re working with any **clinical data**: ‘[Open Data and Data Management in Clinical Research]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7YtnrLPG_A)’.


# Software

- **TU Delft Resources** 
    - [TU Delft programming workshops](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/software-carpentry-workshop)
        - See **[Coach View](https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us/)** for future workshop dates and times

    - [**TU Delft Software Policy and guidelines**](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies)   
        - **Why a research software policy?** The new workflow is an improvement as you don't have to ask the Valorisation Center permission to publish your software through a disclosure form, as long as you follow the workflow.
        - **How to follow the workflow?** A super concise summary is to share your code/software through [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) choosing one of the TU Delft approved licenses (Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, AGPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0)
You can also choose another data repository, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), but then you have to ensure that the output is correctly registered in PURE yourself.) 
    - [TU Delft has its own instance of GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/)  meant particularly for sensitive data/code that cannot be shared externally. 
If you have external collaborators in a project, GitHub is a better solution. 
        - **Where to get help?** Email Esther!

- **Version Control**
    - Blog on [Git or Perish](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sm/2020/08/25/git-or-perish/)
    - Learn more about **version control** in this blogpost on [Why mycode.R_final.v2_usethisone is not helping your workflow](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2020-06-05-why-mycoderfinalv2usethisone-not-helping-your-workflow).
    - If you want to work more collaboratively using version control you can consider using **GitHub or TU Delft GitLab**.
  [TU Delft GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/) is intended for private/secure repositories, whereas [GitHub](https://github.com/) is easier to use if you do not work with sensitive code and need to collaborate with externals. 
    - Learn more about Git and GitHub via [Perez-Riverol et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947)

    - You can also implement GitHub Actions to check for errors in your data processing and cleaning: see [Kim et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13982) for more details.
- You can check out a webinar on [Practicals: Scientific software engineering principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTjgTj6k5kE), where the first talk focuses on **version control** and the last one on **testing**.
- For more resources on **testing**, check out another webinar on [Software Testing in Open Source and Data Science (Eric Ma)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJGgVoV4GTc).

    - [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great platform to share software but it won’t **preserve your code for the long term** (for example, GitHub changed github.com to github.io, resulting in a lot of broken links). 
Instead, you can preserve a snapshot of your code on either [Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) or [4TU.ResearchData (Connecting your GitHub/GitLab account)](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/about-your-data/getting-started).

# (Open) Peer Review
- **The Turing Way** has a chapter on [Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review.html), including a section on [Open Peer Review](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/peer-review/peer-review-open.html).

Write their names down somewhere (a reviewers.txt file). 
Or check which articles/authors you're citing!
