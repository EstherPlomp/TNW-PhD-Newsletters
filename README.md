# Open Publishing
- [Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/)
- Webinar: ['How to get published and best practice for open research'](https://codata.org/initiatives/data-skills/codata-connect/webinar-series-research-skills/webinar-5-how-to-get-published-and-best-practice-for-open-research/)
- [SciPost](https://scipost.org/)
- Using [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.tw/) to obtain access to paywalled articles is effective but actually illegal. 
Please consider using the [Unpaywall plugin](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension) for Firefox and Chrome to access these articles. 
- eLife released a **new article format**: [Executable Research Article](https://elifesciences.org/labs/dc5acbde/welcome-to-a-new-era-of-reproducible-publishing). 
This format allows for live code, data and interactive figures next to your manuscript.
- To avoid publishing with **predatory publishers** check out the checklists for [books](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/books-and-chapters/) and [journals](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) from [Think, check, submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/).

- Two videos on the [workings of the publishing system](https://twitter.com/dglaucomflecken/status/1493946227985059841?s=21) and [article processing fees from Nature](https://twitter.com/dglaucomflecken/status/1484679759829209090) by Dr. Glaucomflecken were quite the hit on Twitter in the past month.
- In related news, [publishers now also tag PDFs with a unique hash](https://twitter.com/json_dirs/status/1486120144141123584), so you may want to be careful with how you share articles that are not Open Access (and publish Open Access where you can!)
- A way to make the submitted version of your article openly accessible are **preprints**! If you haven't heard about those yet, here are a couple of resources: 
  - [On Preprints](http://academiclifehistories.weebly.com/blog/on-preprints)
  - eLife now only reviews and publishes articles that are shared as a preprint. 
    Read more about how this works in their [guide for authors](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/fa9de0e7/preprint-review-a-guide-for-authors)
  - Having doubts about posting a preprint? 
    Read a [blogpost about experiences with sharing a first preprint](https://veronikach.com/phd-advice/firsts-publishing-a-preprint-before-submitting-the-paper/) or ["Why do some researchers have reservations about preprints?"](https://asapbio.org/march-community-call)
