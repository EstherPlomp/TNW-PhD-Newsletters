# Software

- **TU Delft Resources** 
    - [TU Delft programming workshops](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/software-carpentry-workshop)
        - See **[Coach View](https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us/)** for future workshop dates and times

    - [**TU Delft Software Policy and guidelines**](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies)   
        - **Why a research software policy?** The new workflow is an improvement as you don't have to ask the Valorisation Center permission to publish your software through a disclosure form, as long as you follow the workflow.
        - **How to follow the workflow?** A super concise summary is to share your code/software through [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) choosing one of the TU Delft approved licenses (Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, AGPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0)
You can also choose another data repository, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), but then you have to ensure that the output is correctly registered in PURE yourself.) 
        - **Where to get help?** Email Esther!

- [Webinar on Open Software licenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9y8a3O4fjg), where they also discuss **readme files** (30.48 – 41:00), which you need for your project to describe it to others and tell them how to interact with your code/software. You can also learn about **contribution guidelines** and how to set up a **code of conduct** (46:00 – 1:01) from the same webinar.
