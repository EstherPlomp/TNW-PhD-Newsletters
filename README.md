# Software

- **TU Delft Resources** 
    - [TU Delft programming workshops](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/training-events/training-for-researchers/software-carpentry-workshop)
        - See **[Coach View](https://tudelftgs.opleidingsportaal.nl/en-us/)** for future workshop dates and times
    - **TU Delft Digital Competence Center**: Learn more about what [type of data/code support the DCC offers on their website](https://dcc.tudelft.nl/) 
    - [Code Refinery](https://coderefinery.org/)
    - [**TU Delft Software Policy and guidelines**](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/policies/tu-delft-faculty-policies)   
        - **Why a research software policy?** The new workflow is an improvement as you don't have to ask the Valorisation Center permission to publish your software through a disclosure form, as long as you follow the workflow.
        - **How to follow the workflow?** A super concise summary is to share your code/software through [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/) choosing one of the TU Delft approved licenses (Apache, MIT, BSD, EUPL, AGPL, LGPL, GPL, CC0)
You can also choose another data repository, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), but then you have to ensure that the output is correctly registered in PURE yourself.) 
    - [TU Delft has its own instance of GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/)  meant particularly for sensitive data/code that cannot be shared externally. 
If you have external collaborators in a project, GitHub is a better solution. 
        - **Where to get help?** Email Esther!

Instead, you can preserve a snapshot of your code on either [Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) or [4TU.ResearchData (Connecting your GitHub/GitLab account)](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/about-your-data/getting-started).

- PLOS ONE introduced two new publication formats: [Lab Protocols and Study Protocols!](https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/submit-your-lab-and-study-protocols-plos-one/)
- Did your recent experiment fail? 
[This Twitter post](https://twitter.com/IamKhanPhD/status/1450815000222838784) or a more serious [blogpost on negative results](https://medium.com/psychphdpathway/emptying-psychologys-file-drawer-6909cf6b7eb) are for you.

- [SciPost](https://scipost.org/)
- Using [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.tw/) to obtain access to paywalled articles is effective but actually illegal. 
Please consider using the [Unpaywall plugin](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension) for Firefox and Chrome to access these articles. 
- eLife released a **new article format**: [Executable Research Article](https://elifesciences.org/labs/dc5acbde/welcome-to-a-new-era-of-reproducible-publishing). 
This format allows for live code, data and interactive figures next to your manuscript.
- To avoid publishing with **predatory publishers** check out the checklists for [books](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/books-and-chapters/) and [journals](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) from [Think, check, submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/).

- Two videos on the [workings of the publishing system](https://twitter.com/dglaucomflecken/status/1493946227985059841?s=21) and [article processing fees from Nature](https://twitter.com/dglaucomflecken/status/1484679759829209090) by Dr. Glaucomflecken were quite the hit on Twitter in the past month.
- In related news, [publishers now also tag PDFs with a unique hash](https://twitter.com/json_dirs/status/1486120144141123584), so you may want to be careful with how you share articles that are not Open Access (and publish Open Access where you can!)
- A way to make the submitted version of your article openly accessible are **preprints**! If you haven't heard about those yet, here are a couple of resources: 
  - [On Preprints](http://academiclifehistories.weebly.com/blog/on-preprints)
  - eLife now only reviews and publishes articles that are shared as a preprint. 
    Read more about how this works in their [guide for authors](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/fa9de0e7/preprint-review-a-guide-for-authors)
  - Having doubts about posting a preprint? 
    Read a [blogpost about experiences with sharing a first preprint](https://veronikach.com/phd-advice/firsts-publishing-a-preprint-before-submitting-the-paper/) or ["Why do some researchers have reservations about preprints?"](https://asapbio.org/march-community-call)

    - The [Open Grants repository](https://www.ogrants.org/) contains grant applications that got funded or rejected that can serve as an example.
- [Hsu et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj2604) contains short **interviews** with people in academic hiring committees (pages 9-11) that provides some insights in the hiring process (publications/funding may be less important if you have a clear vision on your work and are able to communicate your research well!). While the data is based on neuroscientists, some of the things are more generally applicable (such as institutions showing a preference for hiring individuals that they know).
